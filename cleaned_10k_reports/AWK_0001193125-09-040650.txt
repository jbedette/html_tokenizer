business our company. 4 american water works company, inc., a delaware corporation, is the most geographically diversified as well as the largest, as measured both by operating revenue and population served, investorowned united states water and wastewater utility company. our approximately 7,300 employees provide approximately 15million people with drinking water, wastewater and other waterrelated services in 32 states and ontario, canada. in 2008, we generated 2,336.9 million in total operating revenueand 186.9 million in operating loss, which includes 750.0 million of impairment charges relating to continuing operations, and a net loss of 562.4 million. in 2007, we generated 2,214.2 million in total operating revenue, representing approximately four the operating revenue of the next largest investorowned company in the united states water and wastewater business, and 15.1 million in operating income which includes 509.3 million of impairment charges relating to continuing operations. 4 we have two operating segments which are also the company's two reportable segments, which we refer to as the regulated businesses and nonregulated businesses segments. for further details on our segments, see note 22 of the consolidated financial statements. for 2008, our regulated businesses generated 2,082.7 million in operating revenue, which accounted for 89.1 of total operating revenue. for the same period, our nonregulated businesses generated 272.2 million, in operating revenue, which accounted for 11.6 of total consolidated operating revenue. for additional financial information, please see the financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form 10k. our history as a public company. 4 the company was founded in 1886 as the american water worksamp. guarantee company, for the purposes of building and purchasing water systems in mckeesport, pennsylvania. in 1935, the company was reorganized under its current name, and in 1947 the common stock of the company became publicly traded on the nyse. prior to being acquired by rwe aktiengesellschaft, which we refer to as rwe, a stock corporation incorporated in the federal republic of germany, in 2003, we were the largest publicly traded water utility company as measured both by operating revenue and population served in the united states. our acquisition by rwe in 2003, we were acquired by rwe and were no longer a publicly traded company. the rwe acquisition resulted in certain changes in our business. for example, our operations and management were managed through thames water plc, a former subsidiary of rwe, which we refer to as thames water. also, we agreed not to file rate cases with certain state commissions or other entities engaged in economic regulation of our subsidiaries, which we refer to as pucs, for specified periods of time as a condition of the acquisition. all rate stayout provisions associated with the rwe acquisition have expired. on september28, 2007, thames water aqua us holdings, inc., which we refer to as thames us holdings, at the time an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of rwe, was merged with and into american water with american water being the surviving entity, which we refer to as the merger. in 2005, rwe decided to divest american water and in march 2006, decided to effect the divestiture through the sale of shares in one or more public offerings. our initial public offering. 4 upon the completion of our initial public offering in april 2008, we again became listed on the nyse under the symbol "awk" and resumed our position as the largest publicly traded water utility company in the united states. 3 table of contents regulated businesses overview. 4 our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial and industrial customers. our subsidiaries that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by the state pucs in the states in which they operate. the federal government and the states also regulate environmental, health and safety and water quality matters. we report the results of this business in our regulated businesses segment. the following charts set forth operating revenue for 2008 and customers as of december 31, 2008, respectively for the states in which our regulated businesses provide services regulated businesses operating revenue dollars in millions regulated businesses customers nonregulated businesses overview font face new roman we also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs through our nonregulated businesses. our nonregulated businesses include. - our contract operations group, which enters into publicprivate partnerships, including operations and maintenance, which we refer to as oamp.m, and design, build and operate, which we refer to as dbo contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for municipalities, the united states military and other customers. - our applied water management group, which works with customers to design, build and operate small water and wastewater treatment plants. - our homeowner services group, which provides services to domestic homeowners to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking pipes inside and outside their homes. and - terratec environmental ltd., which we refer to as terratec, which primarily provides wastewater, residuals, transport, disposal and management services to municipal and industrial customers in ontario, canada. we report the results of these lines of business in our nonregulated businesses segment. for 2008, operating revenue for our nonregulated businesses was 272.2million prior to intersegment eliminations, 4 table of contents accounting for 11.6 of total operating revenue for the same period. nonregulated business operating revenues were 242.7 million for 2007 and 248.5 million for 2006 accounting for 11.0 and 11.9 respectively, of total operating revenues for the same periods. our industry overview the united states water and wastewater industry has two main segments iutility, which involves supplying water and wastewater services to consumers, and iigeneral services, which involves providing water and wastewaterrelated services to water and wastewater utilities and other customers on a contract basis. the utility segment includes municipal systems, which are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions, and investorowned systems. the environmental protection agency "epa" estimates that governmentowned systems make up the vast majority of the united states water and wastewater utility segment, accounting for approximately 84 of all united states community water systems and approximately 98 of all united states community wastewater systems. investorowned water and wastewater systems account for the remainder of the united states water and wastewater community water systems. growth of service providers in the utility segment is achieved through acquisitions, including small water and wastewater systems, typically serving fewer than 10,000 customers, in close geographic proximity to where we currently operate our regulated business, which we refer to as "tuckins," of other water and wastewater systems and organic growth of the population served by such providers. 4 the utility segment is characterized by high barriers to entry, including high capital spending requirements. investorowned water and wastewater utilities also face regulatory approval processes in order to do business, which may involve obtaining relevant operating approvals, including certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations from state pucs. investorowned water and wastewater systems are generally economically regulated by the state pucs in the states in which they operate. the federal government and the states also regulate environmental, health and safety and water quality matters for both investorowned and governmentowned water and wastewater utilities. the general services segment includes engineering and consulting companies and numerous other feeforservice businesses. these include the building and operating of water and wastewater utility systems, system repair services, lab services, sale of water infrastructure and distribution products such as pipes and other specialized services. the general services segment is characterized by aggressive competition and marketdriven growth and profit margins. font face new roman the aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the united states is in constant need of modernization and facilities replacement. increased regulations to improve water quality and the management of wastewater discharges, which began with passage of the clean water act in 1972 and the safe drinking water act in 1974, have been among the primary drivers of the need for modernization. the epa estimates that approximately 277billion of capital spending will be necessary between 2003 and 2022 to replace aging infrastructure and to comply with quality standards to ensure quality water systems across the united states. in addition, the epa estimates that approximately 388 billion of capital spending will be necessary between 2000 and 2019 to replace aging infrastructure and ensure quality wastewater systems across the united states. 5 table of contents the following chart sets forth estimated capital expenditure needs from 2003 through 2022 for united states water systems capital expenditures related to municipal water supply, treatment and distribution and wastewater collection and treatment facilities are typically funded by water and wastewater rates, taxes or the issuance of bonds. however, raising large amounts of funds is challenging for municipal water utilities, which impacts their ability to increase capital spending. in order to meet their capital spending challenges, many municipalities are examining a combination of privatizations and partnerships with the private sector. privatization involves a transfer of responsibility for, and ownership of, the utility from the municipality to the private sector. partnerships between municipalities and the private sector include dbo contracts, own, operate and transfer contracts and own, leaseback and operate contracts. under these types of contracts, the municipality maintains ownership of the water andor wastewater system and the private sector takes responsibility for managing and operating the system. font face new roman over the next five years, we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will total between 4.0 and 4.5 billion. our capital investment includes both infrastructure renewal programs, where we replace existing infrastructure, as needed, and construction of facilities to meet new customer growth. over the next five years, we estimate we will invest approximately 1.3 to 1.4 billion to replace aging infrastructure including mains, meters, and supply and treatment facilities. we estimate that we will invest approximately 1.2 to 1.3 billion in facilities to serve new customer growth over the same period. in addition, we estimate that complying with water quality standards and other regulatory requirements will require approximately 300 to 400 million of investment. we estimate that projects to enhance system reliability, quality of service, and risk reduction will require an investment of approximately 800 million, while efficiency related projects will require an investment of 400 to 600 million. 6 table of contents the charts below set forth our estimated percentage of projected capital expenditures for 2009 to 2013 by purpose of investment and by asset type respectively fragmentation and consolidation font face new roman the utility segment of the united states water and wastewater industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 52,000 community water systems and approximately 16,000 community wastewater facilities, according to the epa. as shown in the charts below, the majority of the approximately 52,000 community water systems are very small, serving a population of 500 or less. new roman the following charts set forth the total united states water industry by system type and the total population served by system type, respectively, for 2008 water statistics. number of united states water systems by type unitedstatespopulationservedbywatersystemtype this large number of relatively small water and wastewater utilities results in inefficiencies in the marketplace, since smaller utilities may not have the operating expertise, financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities. these inefficiencies may 7 table of contents lead to industry consolidation in the future, as the larger investorowned utilities acquire smaller, local water and wastewater systems. larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater systems. in addition, water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of adverse weather, such as droughts, excessive rain and cool temperatures in specific areas. larger utilities are able to spread overhead expenses over a larger customer base, thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer. since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale and sharing of best practices, companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies, lower unit costs and improve service at the same time. water and wastewater rates investorowned water and wastewater utilities generate operating revenue from customers based on rates that are established by state pucs through a ratesetting process that may include public hearings, evidentiary hearings and the submission by the utility of evidence and testimony in support of the requested level of rates. in evaluating a rate case, state pucs typically focus on five areas ithe amount and prudence of investment in facilities considered "used and useful" in providing public service. iithe operating and maintenance costs and taxes associated with providing the service typically by making reference to a representative 12month period of time, known as a test year. iiithe appropriate rate of return. ivthe tariff or rate design that allocates operating revenue requirements equitably across the customer base. and vthe quality of service the utility provides, including issues raised by customers. for most consumers, water and wastewater bills make up a relatively small percentage of household expenditures compared to other utility services. the following chart sets forth the relative cost of water in the united states as a percentage of total household utility expenditures our regulated businesses new roman our core regulated businesses, which consist of locally managed utility subsidiaries that generally are economically regulated by the states in which they operate, accounted for approximately 89.1 of our consolidated operating revenue in 2008. our regulated businesses provide a high degree of financial stability because ihigh barriers to entry provide limited protection from competitive pressures, iieconomic regulation promotes predictability in financial planning and longterm performance through the ratesetting process and iiiour largely residential customer base promotes consistent operating results. 8 table of contents overview of networks, facilities and water supply. 4 our regulated businesses operate in approximately 1,600 communities in 20 states in the united states. our primary operating assets include approximately 80 surface water treatment plants, 600 groundwater treatment plants, 1,100 groundwater wells, 50 wastewater treatment facilities, 1,100 treated water storage facilities, 1,200 pumping stations and 100 dams and 48,000 miles of mains and collection pipes. we own substantially all of the assets used by our regulated businesses. we generally own the land and physical assets used to store, extract and treat source water. typically, we do not own the water itself, which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. sources of supply are seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, we employ sophisticated models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions. surface and groundwater levels are routinely monitored for all supplies so that supply capacity may be predicted and, as needed, mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. the following chart sets forth the sources of water supply for our regulated businesses for 2008 by volume the level of water treatment that we apply varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source. surface water sources, such as rivers, typically require significant filtration, while some groundwater sources, such as aquifers, require chemical treatment only. in addition, a small amount of treated water is purchased from neighboring water purveyors. treated water is transported through an extensive transmission and distribution network, which includes underground pipes, above ground storage facilities and numerous pumping facilities with the ultimate distribution of the treated water to the customers' premises. we also have installed meters to measure the water that we deliver through our distribution network. we employ a variety of methods of meter reading to monitor consumption, ranging from basic mechanical meters read by traveling meter readers to remote "driveby" electronic meter reading equipment. the majority of new meters are able to support future advances in electronic meter reading. 4 the provision of wastewater services involves the collection of wastewater from customers' premises through sewer lines. the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required effluent standards. the treated wastewater is finally returned to the environment as effluent, and the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of in accordance with local standards. maintaining the reliability of our networks is a key activity of our regulated businesses. we have ongoing main renewal programs in all states in which our regulated businesses operate. these programs consist of both 9 table of contents rehabilitation of existing mains and replacement of mains that have reached the end of their useful service life. the decision of whether to replace or rehabilitate our mains is subject to considerations of cost, feasibility and customer service impact. the following table

tennessee, texas and virginia. approximately 83.3 of operating revenue from our regulated businesses in 2008 was generated from approximately 2.7million customers in our seven largest states, as measured by operating revenues. in fiscal year 2008, no single customer accounted for more than 1 of our annual operating revenue. 4 the operational characteristics of our regulated businesses, including water and wastewater networks and infrastructure and water sources and supply, vary on a statebystate basis, as explained below with respect to our top seven states by regulated businesses revenues. new jersey. 4 new jerseyamerican water company, inc., which we refer to as njawc, serves a population of approximately 2.5million. njawc combined with our applied wastewater management inc., which we refer to as awwm, also regulated in new jersey generated approximately 517.7million of operating revenue in 2008, representing approximately 24.9 of operating revenue of our regulated businesses for that period. in new jersey, our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources including streams, lakes and reservoirs and groundwater sources. in 2008, we obtained 65 of our water supply from surface water sources and 30 from groundwater sources. purchased water accounted for 5 of water supply, respectively, for the same period. njawc currently operates seven surface water treatment plants and approximately 150 groundwater treatment plants, which process water extracted from more than 170 groundwater wells. we maintain approximately 150 treated water storage facilities, 140 pumping stations and seven dams, and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise approximately 8,900 miles of mains and collection pipes. both awwm and njawc currently provide wastewater treatment services to small communities in new jersey. 4 in new jersey, in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply, we utilize reservoirs, aquifer storage supplies and seasonal wells to provide for water needs during peak summer seasons. through the 10 table of contents optimization of ground and surface water rights, we are able to balance seasonal fluctuations and provide sufficient water supply to our customers year round. we also maintain drought and emergency plans to minimize the impact on service through a wide range of weather fluctuations. during 2007, njawc entered into an agreement with the city of trenton, new jersey to purchase the assets of the city's water system located in four surrounding communities. the agreement required approval from the new jersey puc. the initial proposed purchase price of 100.0 million was subsequently amended to 75.0 million. in addition, the agreement has been amended to include the provision of technical services from the city over seven years to ensure a smooth transition of ownership at a total cost of 5.0 million. the administrative law judge hearing the matter has issued an initial decision the "initial decision" approving a stipulation of settlement reflecting the changed agreement the "stipulation" and sent the initial decision to the new jersey puc for consideration. on february 25, 2009, a petition seeking a referendum was filed with the city of trenton. the petition seeks to force the city council to reconsider its prior approval of sale, and a vote as to whether the ordinance approving the sale of the system should go forward or be negated. the company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the referendum nor can we provide assurance that the initial decision will ultimately be approved by the new jersey puc. included in the stipulation, and dependent upon final approval, the company intends to purchase finished water from the city of trenton for the next 20 years under a water supply agreement. the acquisition is expected to add approximately 40,000 customers to the company's customer base. pennsylvania. 4 pennsylvaniaamerican water company, which we refer to as pawc, serves a population of approximately 2million and generated approximately 447.9million of operating revenue in 2008, representing approximately 21.5 of operating revenue of our regulated businesses for that period. font face new roman in pennsylvania, our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources including streams, lakes and reservoirs and groundwater sources. in 2008, we obtained 92 of our water supply from surface water sources and 7 from groundwater sources. purchased water accounted for 1 of our water supply for the same period. font face new roman pawc currently operates approximately 35 surface water treatment plants and 70 groundwater treatment plants, which process water extracted from over 100 groundwater wells. we maintain approximately 250 treated water storage facilities, 280 pumping stations and 60 dams, and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise approximately 9,900 miles of mains and collection pipes. we currently operate seven wastewater treatment facilities in pennsylvania. in pennsylvania, in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply, we maintain active drought contingency plans in each of our public water systems. the plans identify the source of supply operations that are used during normal and drought weather conditions and specify measures to be taken at different drought trigger levels to increase supply andor curtail water demand. water allocation and passingflow requirements must be managed to maintain adequate supply to our production facilities. in addition, we have taken action to augment supply in systems that have historically had droughtrelated supply issues such as butler, pennsylvania by finding alternative raw water sources and making finished water interconnections with other systems. new roman illinois illinoisamerican water company, which we refer to as ilawc, serves a population of approximately 1million. ilawc and american lake water company, also a regulated subsidiary in illinois, generated approximately 187.5 million of operating revenue in 2008, representing approximately 9.0 of operating revenue of our regulated businesses for that period. in illinois, our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources including rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs and groundwater

same period. ilawc currently operates approximately five surface water treatment plants and 30 groundwater treatment plants, which process water extracted from more than 60 groundwater wells. we maintain three dams and over 60 treated water storage facilities, 100 pumping stations and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise nearly 4,400 miles of mains and collection pipes. we currently operate 11 wastewater treatment facilities in illinois. in illinois, we utilize a comprehensive planning process to assess source of supply adequacy. this assessment addresses both water quantity and quality features. future customer demand projections are prepared. existing system delivery infrastructure is evaluated to determine the capabilities of addressing anticipated demands. in addition to determining source of supply quantity adequacy, the ability to deliver the appropriate water quality is assessed. this would include compliance with environmental regulations as well as company water quality goals. the planning efforts result in a list of improvements that include source of supply upgrades. missouri. 4 missouriamerican water company, which we refer to as moawc, serves a population of over 1million and generated approximately 181.1million of operating revenue in 2008, representing approximately 8.7 of operating revenue of our regulated businesses for that period. in missouri, our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources including rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs and groundwater sources. in 2008, we obtained 83 of our water supply from surface water sources and 17 from groundwater sources. moawc currently operates six surface water treatment plants and approximately 15 groundwater treatment plants, which process water extracted from over 35 groundwater wells. we maintain one dam, approximately 70 treated water storage facilities, 40 pumping stations and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise nearly 5,700 miles of mains and collection pipes. we currently operate four wastewater treatment facilities in missouri. our ability to ensure adequate supply of water in missouri is enhanced by our comprehensive planning process. in that process, we project future water demands based on historical growth patterns. source of supply improvement projects are planned well in advance of actual need. our operating districts in missouri enjoy abundant water resources with limitation only in our joplin service area where the source of water supply is unable to meet peak demands under drought conditions. to manage this issue on the demand side, the water use of a large industrial customer has been restricted under an interruptible tariff. additional wells have been and will be developed to address shortterm supply deficiencies. moawc is working with a consortium of agencies to determine a longterm supply solution for the joplin, missouri region. indiana. 4 indianaamerican water company, inc., which we refer to as inawc, serves a population of approximately 1million and generated

assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources including rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs and groundwater sources. in 2008, we obtained 39 of our water supply from surface water sources and 59 from groundwater sources. purchased treated water accounted for 2 of water supply for the same period. font face new roman inawc currently operates six surface water treatment plants and approximately 30 groundwater treatment plants, which process water extracted from more than 125 groundwater wells. we maintain six dams and 12 table of contents approximately 70 treated water storage facilities, 50 pumping stations and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise approximately 4,300 miles of mains and collection pipes. we currently operate one wastewater treatment facility in indiana. at inawc, we employ several measures to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply. inawc conducts and updates comprehensive planning studies for each of its water utilities to identify and plan for longterm customer demand trends. in order to provide uninterrupted water service, new source of supply and water treatment capital projects are planned and timed to match increases in customer demand andor changes in the yield of existing sources of supply and treatment capacities. for example, to serve our high growth indianapolis southern suburban market, our london road project will utilize a new well field and treatment plant that will satisfy the significant needs of increased population and economic development. further, these facilities are built to be incrementally expandable to match further growth over the next 10 years. in cases of extreme demand such as drought conditions, customer demandmanagement plans are in place to sustain water sources through to normal demand conditions. inawc noblesville district, a high growth northern suburb of indianapolis, successfully managed high demand in 2007's heat wavedrought condition through the use of its demand management plan. further, emergency connections to alternate water sources are in place in some droughtsensitive indiana american water company, inc. districts. california. 4 californiaamerican water company, which we refer to as cawc, serves a population of approximately 0.6million and generated 128.6million of operating revenue in 2008, representing approximately 6.2 of operating revenue of our regulated businesses for that period. in california, our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources including rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs and groundwater sources. in 2008, we obtained 1 of our water supply from surface water sources and 66 from groundwater sources. purchased treated water accounted for 33 of water supply for the same period. new roman cawc currently operates one surface water treatment plant and approximately 140 groundwater treatment plants, which process water extracted from more than 170 groundwater wells. we maintain three dams, approximately 90 treated water storage facilities, 115 pumping stations, and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise approximately 2,700 miles of mains and collection pipes. we currently operate eight wastewater treatment facilities in california. in california, in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply we are in the permitting stages to obtain approval for the construction of a desalination plant to serve our customers on the monterey peninsula, we are designing new groundwater wells in our larkfield district, and in other areas, we are making arrangements to extend or expand our purchase of water from neighboring water providers. as part of our san clemente dam project, under the supervision of the division of safety of dams dsod, we also have been investigating alternatives for complying with seismic safety requirements at our san clemente dam on the carmel river, including strengthening or removing the dam, and, in february 2009, informed dsod that we plan to implement the dam strengthening project pursuant to our application pending before dsod. west virginia west virginiaamerican water company, which we refer to as wvawc, and its subsidiary bluefield valley water works company, which we refer to as bfv, serve a population of nearly 0.6million and generated approximately 115.7million of operating revenue in 2008, representing approximately 5.5 of operating revenue of our regulated businesses for that period. in west virginia, our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources including streams, lakes and reservoirs, and in 2008 we obtained 100 of our water supply from surface water sources. 13 table of contents wvawc currently operates nine surface water treatment plants. we maintain four dams, approximately 170 treated water storage facilities, 235 pumping stations and our water collection and distribution systems comprise approximately 3,400 miles of mains and collection pipes. we currently operate one wastewater treatment facility in west virginia. in west virginia, our surface water supplies are sufficient to meet demand under all but the most extreme drought conditions. such drought conditions would be atypical for west virginia, which has an average annual rainfall of 44 inches. customers. 4 we have a large and geographically diverse customer base in our regulated businesses. for the purposes of our regulated businesses, each customer represents a connection to our water andor wastewater networks. as in the case of apartment complexes, businesses and many homes, multiple individuals may be served by a single connection. 4 residential customers make up the large majority of customers in all of the states in which we operate. in 2008, residential customers accounted for 91 of the customers and 58 of the operating revenue of our regulated businesses. residential customers are highly predictable water and wastewater services consumers and they generate stable operating revenue over time and across regions. we also serve commercial customers, such as shops and businesses, industrial customers, such as largescale manufacturing and production operations, and public authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools. we supply water to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities and also provide bulk water supplies to other water utilities that distribute them to their own customers. 4 the following table

customers' water consumption, typically on a monthly basis. our wastewater customers are billed either on a fixed charge basis or based on their water consumption. 4 customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions, particularly, during the summer. our water systems experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn irrigation and other outdoor uses. summer weather that is cooler and wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can have a downward effect on water operating revenue and operating income. conversely, when weather conditions are extremely dry, our systems may be affected by droughtrelated warnings andor water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies, also serving to reduce customer demand and operating revenue. these restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level and may affect our service areas, regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands. other factors affecting our customers' usage of water includes declining household sizes in the united states, conservation initiatives, including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers, and the recent deterioration in economy and credit markets which is having an adverse impact on our industrial and commercial customers operational and financial performance. supplies. 4 our water and wastewater operations require an uninterrupted supply of chemicals, energy and fuel, as well as maintenance material and other critical inputs. many of these inputs are subject to shortterm price volatility. longterm volatility is partially mitigated through existing procurement contracts, current supplier continuity plans and the regulatory rate setting process. 4 because of our geographic diversity, we maintain relationships with many chemical, equipment and service suppliers in the marketplace, and we do not rely on any single entity for a material amount of our supplies. we also employ a strategic sourcing process intended to ensure reliability in supply and longterm cost effectiveness. as a result of our strategic sourcing process and our strong relationships with suppliers, we are able to mitigate interruptions in the delivery of the products and services that are critical to our operations. for example, during hurricane katrina, we were challenged to locate chemical suppliers not affected by the hurricane. as a result of our previously negotiated and established relationships with a network of preferred suppliers, we were able to secure an uninterrupted supply of materials and to continue our operations in the affected areas without interruptions. we have backup energy sources at key facilities or alternative sources are available to us that are able to keep our operations running in the event of a temporary loss of our primary energy supplies. regulation economic regulation our subsidiaries in the states in which we operate our regulated businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective state pucs. the term "economic regulation" is intended to indicate that these state pucs regulate the economic aspects of service to the public from systems that fall within their jurisdiction but do not generally establish water quality standards, which are set by the epa andor state environmental authorities and enforced through state environmental or health agencies. state pucs have broad authority, derived from state laws and state constitutions under which they operate, to regulate many of the economic aspects of the utilities that fall within their jurisdiction. for example, state pucs issue certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations that may be required for a company to provide public utility services in specific areas of the state. they also must approve the rates and conditions under which service is provided to customers and have extensive authority to establish rules and regulations under which the utilities operate. although specific authority might differ from state to state, in most states, these state pucs must approve rates, accounting treatments, longterm financing programs, significant capital expenditures and plant additions, transactions between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities, reorganizations and mergers 15 table of contents and acquisitions, in many instances prior to their completion. the jurisdiction exercised by each state puc is prescribed by state laws and regulations and therefore varies from state to state. regulatory policies not only vary from state to state, they may change over time. these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital. economic regulation of utilities deals with many competing, and occasionally conflicting, public interests and policy goals. the primary responsibility of state pucs is to achieve the overall public interest by balancing the interests of customers and the utility and its stockholders. although the specific approach to economic regulation does vary, certain general principles are consistent across the states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate. based on the united states constitution and state constitutions that prohibit confiscation of property without due process of law and just compensation, as well as state statutory provisions and court precedent, utilities are entitled to recover, through rates charged to customers, prudent and reasonable operating costs as well as an opportunity to earn an appropriate return on our prudent, used and useful capital investment necessary to provide service to customers and a return of our prudent, used and useful capital investment necessary to provide service to customers. the state pucs will also generally accord a utility the right to serve specific areas and will also provide investorowned utilities with limited protection from competition because the requirement of an investorowned utility to operate pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations typically prevents other investorowned utilities from competing with it in the authorized area. in return, the utility undertakes to provide reliable service on a nondiscriminatory basis to all customers within the authorized area. 4 our operating revenue is typically determined by reference to the volume of water supplied to a customer multiplied by a pricepergallon set by a tariff approved by the relevant state puc. certain states have utilized a full or partial single rate policy, under which all customers in a state or certain regions within a state are charged utilizing a single rate structure, regardless of which of our individual systems serves them. the single tariff structure is based on costs that are determined on a statewide or intrastate regional basis, thereby moderating the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs while lowering administrative costs for us and our customers. the process to obtain approval for a change in rates, or rate case, involves filing a petition with the state puc on a periodic basis as determined by our capital expenditures needs and our operating costs. rate cases are normally initiated by the regulated utility whenever the utility determines it needs to recover increased operating expenses or a return on new capital investment, or otherwise determines that its current authorized return is not sufficient, given current market conditions, to provide a reasonable return on investment. typically a rate case will not be filed, however, unless the current or expected future return is below the allowed rate of return currently authorized by the regulator. a state puc may also initiate a rate proceeding or investigation if it believes a utility may be earning in excess of its authorized rate of return. rate cases often involve a lengthy and costly administrative process. the utility, the state puc staff, consumer advocates and any other interveners who may participate in the process prepare and file evidence, consisting of supporting testimony and documentation. this is presented in public hearings in connection with the rate case. these hearings, which are economic and service quality factfinding in nature, are typically conducted in a triallike setting before the state puc or an administrative law judge. during the process, the utility is required to provide staff and interveners with all relevant information they may request concerning the utility's operations, expenses and investments. the sworn evidentiary record then forms the basis for a state puc decision. some state pucs are more restrictive than others with regard to the types of expenses and investments that may be recovered in rates as well as with regard to the transparency of their ratemaking processes, and how they reach their final rate determinations. however, in evaluating a rate case, state pucs typically focus on five areas - the amount and prudence of investment in facilities considered "used and useful" in providing public service. - the operating and maintenance costs and taxes associated with providing the service typically by making reference to a representative 12month period of time, known as a test year. - the appropriate rate of return. 16 table of contents - the tariff or rate design that allocates operating revenue requirements equitably across the customer base. and. - the quality of service the utility provides, including issues raised by customers. 4 the decisions of state pucs and the timing of those decisions can have a significant impact on the operations and earnings of our regulated businesses. rate cases and other raterelated proceedings can take several months to over a year to complete. therefore, there is frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates. for instance, an unexpected increase in chemical costs or new capital investment that is not appropriately reflected in the most recently completed rate case will generally not be recovered by the regulated subsidiary until the next rate case is filed and approved by the state puc. our rate case management program is guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of costs of capital and utility operating and maintenance costs, including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations. the management team at each of our regulated subsidiaries anticipates the time required for the regulatory process and files a rate case with the goal of obtaining rates that reflect as closely as possible the cost of providing service at the time the rates become effective. even if rates are sufficient, we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital that are permitted by the state puc. our regulated subsidiaries also pursue methods to minimize the adverse impact of regulatory lag and have worked with state pucs and legislatures to implement a number of approaches to achieve this result. a number of states in which our regulated businesses operate have adopted efficient rate policies, including some form of single tariff pricing, forwardlooking test years, passthrough provisions or infrastructure surcharges. forwardlooking test years and infrastructure surcharges reduce the regulatory lag associated with the traditional method of recovering rates from state pucs through lengthy rate cases based on historical information. pennsylvania, new jersey, west virginia, kentucky, ohio, indiana and illinois are examples of states that have adopted a full or partial single tariff pricing policy. also, an increasing number of states are permitting rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs, such as a return on capital investments to replace aging infrastructure or increases in expenses beyond the utility's control, such as purchased water costs. this infrastructure surcharge mechanism allows our rates to be adjusted and charged to customers outside the context of a general rate proceeding for prespecified portions of our capital expenditures to replace aging infrastructure closer to the time these expenses are incurred. for example, pennsylvania, illinois, missouri, indiana, new york, and ohio are examples of states that have in the past allowed tariffs that permit the imposition of surcharges on customers' bills for infrastructure replacement. new jersey, california, virginia and illinois have allowed surcharges for purchased water costs, california has allowed surcharges for power, and new york has allowed surcharges for certain costs such as power and chemicals. these constructive regulatory mechanisms encourage us to maintain a steady capital expenditure program to repair and improve water and wastewater systems as needed by reducing the regulatory lag on the recovery of prudent expenditures. new roman the forwardlooking test year mechanism allows us to earn on a more timely basis a return of our current or projected costs and a rate of return on our current or projected invested capital and other "known and measurable changes" in our business. some states have permitted use of some form of forecast or forwardlooking test year instead of historical data to set rates. examples of these states include illinois, kentucky, ohio, pennsylvania, new york, tennessee and california. in addition, a number of states in which we operate have allowed the utility to update historical data for certain changes that occur for some limited period of time subsequent to the historical test year. this allows the utility to take account of some more current costs or capital investments in the ratesetting process. examples of these states include new mexico, texas, missouri, iowa, virginia, maryland, west virginia, new jersey and arizona. 4 also, some of the states in which we operate permit passthrough provisions that allow for an increase in certain operating costs, such as purchased power and property taxes to be passed on to and recovered from customers outside of a general rate case proceeding. 17 table of contents another regulatory mechanism to address issues of regulatory lag includes the potential ability, in certain circumstances, to recover in rates a return on utility plant before it is actually in service, instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction. examples of states that have allowed such recovery include texas, pennsylvania, ohio, kentucky, virginia, illinois and california. in addition, some states have permitted us to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs. in this preapproval process, the pucs assess the prudency of such projects. the ability of the company to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state pucs will accept the company's proposal in the context of a particular rate case. however, the company strives to use these and other regulatory policies to address issues of regulatory lag wherever appropriate and to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply. environmental, health and safety and water quality regulation our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal, state and local and, in the case of our canadian operations, canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect, treat, discharge and dispose of wastewater. we are also subject to certain regulations regarding fire protection services in the areas we serve. these regulations include the safe drinking water act, the clean water act and other federal, state, local and canadian laws and regulations governing the provision of water and wastewater services, particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute. we also are subject to various federal, state, local and canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. new roman we maintain a comprehensive environmental policy including responsible business practices, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, effective use of natural resources, and stewardship of biodiversity. we believe that our operations are in material compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations. water samples across our water system are analyzed on a regular basis in material compliance with regulatory requirements. across the company, we conduct nearly one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities in addition to continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels, disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water. for 2008, we achieved greater than a 99.9 compliance rate for meeting state and federal drinking water standards and 99.2 for compliance with wastewater requirements. we participate in the partnership for safe water, the united states epa's voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbes. currently, 70 of our facilities have received the program's "director" award and 65 have maintained it for more than five years. font face new roman for fiscal year 2008, our aggregate capital expenditures for environmental, health and safety and water quality regulatory compliance were approximately 150.0 million, and we currently expect to spend similar amounts for such matters in fiscal year 2009. safe drinking water act font face new roman the federal safe drinking water act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water. the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules. these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting contaminants, the treatment systems which may be used for removing contaminants and other requirements. federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly more stringent, including increased water testing requirements, to reflect public health concerns. 18 table of contents for example, in 2001, the epa decreased permissible arsenic levels in drinking water and required compliance by water systems by january2006. in 2003, a new epa rule governing nonradon radionuclides became effective, regulating uranium in drinking water for the first time and requiring initial monitoring under state programs by the end of 2007. we believe that we are in material compliance with both these rules. in order to remove or inactivate microbial organisms, the epa has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers' exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process. in january 2006, the epa promulgated the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule. in october 2006, the epa finalized the ground water rule, applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources. in 2006, the epa also proposed revisions to the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing lead and copper rule. although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, we do not expect current requirements under the safe drinking water act to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition. in addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by state public utility commissions as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. as a result, we expect to fully recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements. clean water act. 4 the federal clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. in addition to requirements applicable to our sewer collection systems, our operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system, or npdes, permit program established under the clean water act. pursuant to the npdes program, the epa or implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. we believe that we maintain the necessary permits and approvals for the discharges from our water and wastewater facilities. from time to time, discharge violations occur at our facilities, some of which result in fines. we do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. other environmental, health and safety and water quality matters font face new roman our operations also involve the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. for example, our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals and generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements. we also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite disposal of wastes. although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs. our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements under the united states occupational safety and health act and are subject to inspections thereunder. for further information, see "business151.research and development.". 4 certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters. these proceedings are described further in the section entitled "item 3151.legal proceedings." growth. 4 in the course of pursuing our growth strategy, we periodically acquire water and wastewater utilities by making acquisitions in our existing markets and certain markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses. we have executed a number of larger acquisitions in the past 10 years. in 1996, our regulated subsidiary, pawc, acquired the regulated water utility operations of pennsylvania gas and water company, a subsidiary of pennsylvania enterprises inc., for approximately 409.4million. in 1999, we 19 table of contents acquired the privately held national enterprises inc., in a transaction valued at 700.0million. in 2002, we acquired the water and wastewater facilities in six states from citizens communications company for an aggregate purchase price of 979.8million. we also acquire water and wastewater utilities through tuckins. the proximity of tuckin opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations using our existing management and to achieve efficiencies. historically, pursuing tuckins has been a fundamental part of our growth strategy. we intend to continue to grow our regulated footprint through tuckin acquisitions of small water andor wastewater systems. tuckins allow us to integrate systems, operations and management and achieve efficiencies. we intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and, if appropriate, certain markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses. 4 the chart below sets forth our historical tuckins for 1996 through december 2008. in addition to the 10 acquisitions completed in 2008, there are another three transactions that were signed in 2008 and are expected to be completed in 2009, the largest of which is the trenton acquisition. while our business mix will continue to focus predominantly on regulated activities, we are pursuing opportunities in nonregulated businesses that are complementary to our regulated businesses and our capabilities. we plan to focus on our publicprivate partnerships, including oamp.m and military contracts and services. we intend to capitalize on our oamp.m expertise as well as our existing municipal and government relationships to identify and bid for new ventures that have attractive risk and return characteristics. we also intend to continue to expand our nonregulated homeowner services business, which provides services to domestic homeowners to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking pipes inside and outside their homes, in areas within and beyond our existing regulated footprint. competition and condemnation in our regulated businesses, we generally do not face direct or indirect competition in providing services in our existing markets because iwe operate within those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations issued by state pucs and iithe high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a barrier to market entry. our regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies, other investorowned utilities and strategic buyers in connection with entering new markets and making strategic acquisitions. consolidation is changing the competitive landscape as small local utilities struggle to meet their capital spending requirements and look to partner with investorowned utilities. we also face competition in offering services to new real estate developers, where we compete with others on the basis of the financial terms we offer for our services, the availability of water and our ability to commence providing services on a timely basis. our largest investorowned competitors, based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served, are aqua america inc., united water owned by suez environment company s.a., american states water co. and california water services group. 20 table of contents the certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations pursuant to which we operate our regulated businesses do not prevent municipalities from competing with us to provide water and wastewater utility services. further, the potential exists that portions of our subsidiaries' utility assets could be acquired by municipalities or other local government entities through one or more of the following methods - eminent domain also known as condemnation. - the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original certificate was granted. and. - the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its certificate. the sale price for such a transaction initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law, or the price may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter. we believe our operating subsidiaries would be entitled to fair market value for any assets required to be sold, and we are of the opinion that fair market value would be in excess of the book value for such assets. we are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. on september5, 2008, california american water sold the assets of our felton, california water system, which served approximately 1,330 customers, to the san lorenzo valley water district. the most recent prior sale of our water and wastewater systems under threat of condemnation occurred in 2003. we actively monitor condemnation activities that may affect us as soon as we become aware of them. we do not believe that condemnation poses a material threat to our ability to operate our regulated businesses. our nonregulated businesses. 4 in addition to our regulated businesses, we operate the following nonregulated businesses, which generated 272.2million of operating revenue in 2008 representing 11.6 of total operating revenue for the same periods. no single group within our nonregulated businesses generates in excess of 10 of our aggregate revenue. font face new roman contract operations group our contract operations group enters into publicprivate partnerships, including oamp.m and dbo contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for municipalities, the united states military and other customers. we typically make no capital investment under our contracts with municipalities and other customers, instead performing our services for a fee. we may make limited capital investments under our contracts with the united states military. our contract operations group generated revenue of 170.1 million in 2008, representing 62.5 of revenue for our nonregulated businesses. we are currently party to more than 49 contracts across the united states and canada, with contracts ranging in term from three to 50 years. the services provided under our oamp.m contracts vary in size and scope. for instance, 44 of our oamp.m contracts are operational in nature with repair and replace elements but not dbos. annual operating revenue from the oamp.m contracts varies from 0.3million to 8.2 million per contract. in addition, we are an active participant in the united states department of defense's utility privatization program, or upp. the department of defense has awarded us seven 50year contracts for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems since 2003, and we have one 3year subcontract with a municipality, acting as primary contractor with the department of defense, for similar services on an interim basis until construction of new connections to an existing municipal facility is completed. remaining lifetime revenue under all these oamp.m contracts total approximately 2,288.8 million as of december31, 2008. all of the contracts with the u.s. government may be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the u.s. government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract. in either event, we are entitled to recover the remaining amount of our capital investment pursuant to the terms of a termination settlement with the u.s. government at the time of termination as provided in each of the contracts. 21 table of contents the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter. price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. 4 in general, the contract operations group is engaged in providing these services to systems with over 3,000 customers and in many cases far larger as distinguished from the oamp.m services provided by our applied water management group usually to systems with less than 3,000 customers. however, there is some overlap in size of systems served due to geographic and operational considerations. applied water management group new roman our applied water management group works with customers to design, build and operate smallerscale water and wastewater treatment plants typically serving up to 3,000 customers. our typical customers are real estate developers, industrial companies and new or expanding communities. we specialize in providing reliable, advanced and ecofriendly water and wastewater solutions to suit each customer's water needs. our applied water management group generated revenue of 23.8 million in 2008, representing 8.7 of revenue for our nonregulated businesses. the applied water management group currently serves our customer base primarily in the northeastern united states and was responsible for the design, construction and operation of advanced wastewater treatment recycling systems for sites as varied as residential buildings in battery park city in new york city and gillette stadium in foxborough, massachusetts. approximately 38 of the applied water management group's business involves operating and maintaining smallerscale water and wastewater plants, made up of a mixture of facilities that we designed and built, and some which we only operate. homeowner services group. 4 our homeowner services group provides services to domestic homeowners to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking pipes inside and outside their homes. we initially offered these services within territories covered by our regulated subsidiaries, but are expanding to enable other utilities outside our territories to offer the services to their customers. in the marketing of these services, we focus on educating homeowners about their service line ownership responsibility and providing convenient and cost effective solutions to internal and external water line and sewer line repairs. our homeowner services group generated revenue of 47.5 million in 2008, representing 17.5 of revenue for our nonregulated businesses. our service line protection programs offer customers various service contracts for a monthly fee that cover repair of water line leaks and breaks, sewer line clogs and blockages and emergency inhome plumbing problems. in the event of a problem, customers contact our national call center and we dispatch local contractors to the customer's home to undertake the necessary repairs. our homeowners services group currently has approximately 680,000 customer contracts in 15 of the states where we operate our regulated businesses. we intend to expand our service offering to the remaining key states in which we operate our regulated businesses as well as other viable territories. building on the success of its service line protection programs, our homeowner services group recently introduced linesaver153., an exclusive program for municipalities and public water systems that is available across the country. the linesaver153. program involves partnering with municipalities to offer our protection programs to homeowners serviced by the municipal system while providing an income opportunity to the municipality or public water system. we entered into our first line saver new roman 153. program partnership with the city of trenton, new jersey and are currently discussing partnerships with municipalities across the nation. 22 table of contents other nonregulated businesses. 4 our nonregulated businesses also include iour carbon services group, which provides granular activated carbon for water purification to our regulated businesses as well as certain outside customers and iiour residuals group, terratec, which provides environmentally sustainable management and disposal of biosolids and wastewater byproducts. our united statesbased residuals group was divested effective june29, 2007. these other nonregulated businesses generated revenue of 30.8 million in 2008 in the aggregate, representing 11.3 of revenue for our nonregulated businesses. competition we face competition in our nonregulated businesses from a number of service providers, including veolia, american states, omi and southwest water, particularly in the area of oamp.m contracting. securing new oamp.m contracts is highly competitive, as these contracts are awarded based on a combination of customer relationships, service levels, competitive pricing, references and technical expertise. we also face competition in maintaining existing oamp.m contracts to which we are a party, as these frequently come up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process. research and development. 4 we established a formal research and development program in 1981 with the goal of improving water quality and operational effectiveness in all areas of our businesses. our research and development personnel are locatedattwo of our facilities the regional center in voorhees, new jersey and our research laboratory in delran, new jersey. in addition, our quality control and testing laboratory in belleville, illinois supports research through sophisticated testing and analysis. since its inception, our research and development program has evolved to become a leading waterrelated research program, achieving advancements in the science of drinking water, including sophisticated water testing procedures and desalination technologies. since the formation of the epa in 1970, we have collaborated with the agency to achieve effective environmental, health and safety and water quality regulation. this relationship has developed to include sharing of our research and national water quality monitoring data in addition to our treatment and distribution system optimization research. our engagement with the epa has helped us to achieve a leadership position for our company within the water and wastewater industry and has provided us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives, thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements. in 2008, we spent 2.5 million on research and development, which represents an increase of 25 over the 2.0 million spent in 2007. approximately onethird of our research budget iscomprised of competitively awarded outside research grants. such grantsreduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers. we believe that continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position in the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers. support services our american water works service company subsidiary provides centrally administered professional services to our regulated businesses under the terms of contracts with these companies that have been approved by state pucs, where necessary. these services, which are provided at cost, may include accounting, administration, business development, communications, corporate secretarial, engineering, financial, health and safety, human resources, information systems, legal, operations, procurement, rates, security, risk management, water quality and research and development. similar services may be provided to our nonregulated businesses. these arrangements afford our affiliated companies professional and technical talent on an economical and timely basis. 23 table of contents we operate two national customer service centers, with personnel located in alton, illinois and pensacola, florida. these centers employ approximately 700 people in total and process telephone calls from customers across all of our service areas. new roman community relations corporate responsibility is a critical part of how we do business at american water. from our community involvement to the steps we have taken to reduce our environmental footprint, we believe that we have the opportunity to drive our business from a broader perspective, one that inspires and wins customer, community, employee and shareholder loyalty and support through responsible business practices. corporate responsibility encompasses four main areas at american water, including environmental responsibility, economic health, social wellbeing and governance. together, these focus areas are designed to create shareholder value in a number of ways including, attracting and retaining talent, avoiding operational and reputational risk and identifying new opportunities that respond to sustainable solutions. communication activities for our regulated businesses are designed to ensure that our customers, regulators, elected and appointed officials, as well as, community leaders are fully informed about water and wastewaterrelated issues affecting their communities. we focus on developing effective relationships and have in place experienced staff members in the areas of community relations, government relations, media relations and marketing. we believe that an informed customer is more likely to be a satisfied customer. our primary focus for our regulated businesses is on consumer education. we target our communications to ensure that all of our audiences are well informed and uptodate on water and wastewaterrelated issues through community outreach meetings, bill inserts to our customers, newspaper articles on timely topics, paid advertisements on important issues, annual water quality reports or oneonone meetings to update key community and government leaders. we continually provide information on topics such as the need for infrastructure investments that we are making within a community, the impact on rates and services, water supply needs, water conservation requirements, as well as information on water quality. we believe that educating our customers about these topics leads to greater understanding of the service issues that we face and results in a higher level of customer satisfaction. for instance, we believe that our customers are less likely to react negatively to a rate increase if they have been informed that the rate increase is necessitated by an infrastructure investment necessary to continue to provide high quality water service. we also believe that our customers are less likely to have a negative reaction to water use restrictions if they understand the reasons behind the restrictions and that all customers are being impacted by the same inconveniences. communications activities for our nonregulated businesses focus on identifying prospective market opportunities for growth and expansion and educating target markets on the value we can bring to solving specific water supply, water quality or other water and wastewaterrelated issues. our experienced business development team reinforces the expertise, experience and capabilities we can provide to communities or developers through industry trade shows, public speaking opportunities, industry conferences and paid advertising, publicprivate partnerships or contract relationships, which may include dbo projects for customers or providing experienced oamp.m services for various sized water and wastewaterrelated projects. employee matters currently we employ approximately 7,300 fulltime employees. of these, approximately 3,700, or approximately 51, are represented by unions. we have 76 collective bargaining agreements in place with the 20 different unions representing our unionized employees. approximately onefourth of our local union contracts expire annually. we maintain good relations with our unionized workforce and have no significant history of strikes or labor stoppages. 24 table of contents training new roman we place emphasis on the selection of wellqualified employees and seek to provide the best and most uptodate training to ensure that our water and wastewater operations function efficiently and safely. we provide internal training programs designed to meet the standards demanded by the regulatory authorities in the states where we operate our regulated business. security due to terrorist and other risks, we have heightened security at our facilities over the past several years and have taken added precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to our customers. we have a security programs department that provides oversight and governance of physical and information security throughout our operations and is responsible for designing, implementing, monitoring and supporting active and effective physical and information security controls. in 2002, federal legislation was enacted that resulted in new regulations concerning security of water facilities, including those that required companies to submit vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government. we have complied with epa regulations concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required. vulnerability assessments are conducted regularly to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basis for further capital investment in security for the facility. information security controls are deployed or integrated to prevent unauthorized access to company information systems, assure the continuity of business processes dependent upon automation, ensure the integrity of our data and support regulatory and legislative compliance requirements. in addition, communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures. while we do not make public comments on the details of our security programs, we have been in contact with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of our water delivery systems and to safeguard our water supply. font face new roman available information we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. we file or furnish

factors we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form10k, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be adversely affected, which in turn could adversely affect the value of our common stock. new roman risks related to our industry and business our utility operations are heavily regulated. decisions by state pucs and other regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business and results of operations. our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries economically regulated by state pucs. economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant effect on our business and results of operations. generally, the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses, to enable us to finance the addition of new, or the replacement of existing, water and wastewater infrastructure and to allow us the opportunity to earn what they determine to be an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital. font face new roman our ability to meet our financial objectives depends upon the rates authorized by the various state pucs. we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs. the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted. even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses, the recovery of our investment andor provide us an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment. if the authorized rates are insufficient to cover operating expenses, to allow for the recovery of our investment and to provide an appropriate return on invested capital, or if the rate increase decisions are delayed, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity may be adversely affected. even if rates are sufficient, we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital that are permitted by the state puc. new roman our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. our operating costs have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, as a result of complying with environmental laws and regulations. we also could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations. new roman our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal, state and local and, in the case of our canadian operations, canadian, laws and regulations, that govern the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, discharge and dispose of wastewater. these requirements include the united states clean water act of 1972, which we refer to as the clean water act, and the united states safe drinking water act of 1974, which we refer to as the safe drinking water act, and similar state and canadian laws and regulations. we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards, or otherwise violate environmental laws, regulations or permits, or other health and safety and water quality regulations, we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs or damage to our reputation. in the most serious cases, regulators could force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or municipality. given the nature of our business which, in part, involves supplying water for human 26 table of contents consumption, any potential noncompliance with, or violation of, environmental laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to an issuer not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry. we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws and regulations and other health and safety and water quality regulations. these laws and regulations, and their enforcement, have tended to become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs. although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our rates, there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases to recover such costs or that such costs will not adversely and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. font face new roman we may also incur liabilities under environmental laws and regulations requiring us to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused adverse environmental impacts. the discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result in significant costs, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. such remediation losses may not be covered by our insurance policies and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates. market disruptions caused by the worldwide financial crisis could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we rely on our revolving credit facility and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs. further disruptions in the credit markets or further deterioration of the banking industry's financial condition, may discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets. on september 15, 2008, we sought to issue commercial paper but were unable to consummate the issuance due to adverse market conditions. in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we are borrowing under our existing 840 million revolving credit facility. commitments under this revolving credit facility of 685 million mature on september 15, 2013, and the remaining 155 million expire on september 15, 2012. american water capital corp. "awcc", our financing subsidiary, had 345.0 million of outstanding borrowings and 43.9 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 23, 2009. awcc had 178.5 million of outstanding overnight commercial paper as of february 23, 2009. we can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. new roman as of december 31, 2008, the company has issued through its subsidiaries 120.3 million of variable rate demand bonds which are periodically remarketed. during the months of january and february 2009, awcc purchased its variable rate demand bonds because no buyer was willing to purchase the bonds at market rates. at february 23, 2009, awcc holds all 120.3 million in treasury. we can provide no assurances that the bonds will be remarketed successfully or at reasonable interest rates. longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business. any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged. such measures could include deferring capital expenditures, reducing dividend payments, and reducing other discretionary expenditures. new roman continued market disruptions could cause a broad economic downturn which may lead to increased incidence of customers' failure to pay for services delivered, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. the capital market disruptions could result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities, increased commercial paper borrowing costs, and increased costs related to variable rate debt. as a result, continuation of the market disruptions could increase the company's interest expense and adversely impact our results of operations. 27 table of contents the disruption in the capital markets and its actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy also adversely affects the value of the investments held within the company's employee benefit plan trusts. significant declines in the value of the investments held within the company's employee benefit plan trusts may require the company to increase contributions to those trusts in order to meet future funding requirements if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value in the foreseeable future. these trends may also adversely impact the company's results of operations, net cash flows and financial positions, including our shareholders' equity. market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding. the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the company's pension and postretirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position. the company has significant obligations in these areas and the company holds significant assets in these trusts. these assets are subject to market fluctuations, which may affect investment returns, which may fall below the company's projected return rates. a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, as was experienced in 2008, will increase the funding requirements under the company's pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value. additionally, the company's pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. also, future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable from our customers, and our the results of operations and financial position of the company could be negatively affected. during 2008, the company's unfunded status of its pension plan increased significantly primarily due to lower than expected 2008 asset returns, which are expected to result in increased benefit costs and required funding contributions in future years. based on current plan assets and expected future asset returns, the company currently estimates the increase to pension and postretirement expense net of capitalized amounts in 2009 to be approximately 32 million, pretax. it is the company's intent to work with pucs in the states in which it operates to minimize the impact of such increases on its results of operations. the company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 125.9 million, 132.5 million, 124.7 million, 161.9 million and 123.2 million in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates. font face new roman changes in laws and regulations over which we have no control can significantly affect our business and results of operations. 4 any governmental entity that regulates our operations may enact new legislation or adopt new regulations or policies at any time, and new judicial decisions may change the interpretation of existing legislation or regulations at any time. the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or are political appointees. therefore, elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. new laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or changes in agency policy, including as a response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process may affect our business in a number of ways, including the following. - making it more difficult for us to raise our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return. - changing the determination of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases. 28 table of contents - changing water quality or delivery service standards or wastewater collection, treatment, discharge and disposal standards with which we must comply. - restricting our ability to terminate our services to customers who owe us money for services previously provided. - requiring us to provide water services at reduced rates to certain customers. - restricting our ability to sell assets or issue securities. - changing regulatory benefits that we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area. - changing or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock. - making it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via eminent domain. - restricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers. and. - revoking or altering the terms of the certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations issued to us by state pucs. any of these changes or any other changes in laws, regulations, judicial decisions or agency policies applicable to us may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. weather conditions, natural hazards, availability of water supplies and competing uses may interfere with our sources of water, demand for water services and our ability to supply water to customers. 4 our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. as a general rule, sources of public water supply, including rivers, lakes, streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests. as such, we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations, and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities. passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources, such as rivers and streams, in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users. allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passing flow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers, lakes and streams. these requirements can change from time to time and adversely impact our water supply. drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. governmental restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. seasonal drought conditions that would impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas, and drought conditions currently exist in several areas of the united states. however, these conditions are more prevalent in the northeast and west where supply capacity is limited and per capita water demand is high. if a regional drought were to occur affecting our service areas and adjacent systems, governmental restrictions may be imposed on all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system. there have been no mandatory water use restriction orders to date in 2009, although voluntary conservation efforts or water use restrictions were implemented during certain periods of 2008 in parts of new jersey, new mexico, new york and california. following drought conditions, water demand may not return to predrought levels even after restrictions are lifted. cool and wet weather may also reduce demand for water, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. 29 table of contents service interruptions due to severe weather events are possible across all our service areas. these include winter storms and freezing conditions in our colder climate service areas, high wind conditions in our service areas known to experience tornados, earthquakes in our service areas known to experience seismic activity, high water conditions for our facilities located in or near designated flood plains, hurricanes in our coastal service areas and severe electrical storms which are possible across all of our service areas. these weather events may affect the condition or operability of our facilities, limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers, or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage. any interruption in our ability to supply water or to collect, treat and properly dispose of wastewater, or any costs associated with restoring service, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, losses from business interruptions or damage to our facilities might not be covered by our insurance policies and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates. declining residential per customer water usage may reduce our longterm revenues, financial condition and results of operations. increased water conservation, including through the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers, combined with declining household sizes in the united states, has contributed to a trend of declining residential per customer water usage. our regulated businesses are heavily dependent upon revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use. the rate we charge for our water is regulated by state pucs, and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect demand. declining usage will have a negative impact on our longterm operating revenues if we are unable to secure rate increases or to grow our residential customer base to the extent necessary to offset the residential usage decline. risks associated with the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs. the wastewater collection, treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks. if collection or sewage systems fail, overflow or do not operate properly, untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages, which may not be recoverable in rates. this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure. liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. moreover, in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow, our losses might not be covered by insurance policies, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates. our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures to maintain infrastructure and expand our rate base and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments, or if we suffer delays in completing major capital expenditure projects. the water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive. in addition to our acquisition strategy, we invest significant amounts of capital to add, replace and maintain property, plant and equipment. in 2008, we invested 1,008.8million in net companyfunded capital improvements. we expect the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems to increase in the future. we fund these projects from cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and the issuance of longterm debt and equity securities. we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt and equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all. rwe has certain registration rights with respect to future issuances of our equity securities and intends to fully divest its remaining ownership of american water as soon as reasonably practicable, subject to market conditions. the registration rights agreement entered into with rwe imposes certain restrictions on our ability to issue equity securities in amounts beyond specified thresholds without rwe's consent. sales of our common stock by rwe, as well as the restrictions in the registration rights agreement, may make it more difficult or 30 table of contents costly for us to raise additional equity in the future. furthermore, if we are unable to raise sufficient equity, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms or at all. in addition, we believe that our dividend policy could limit, but not preclude, our ability to pursue growth. in particular, this limitation could be significant, for example, with respect to large acquisitions and growth opportunities that require cash investments in amounts greater than our operating subsidiaries' available cash or external financing resources. in order to fund construction expenditures, acquisitions including tuckin acquisitions and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, and pay dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy, we expect that we will need additional financing. however, we intend to retain sufficient cash from operating activities after the distribution of dividends to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. for further discussion of our acquisition strategy, see "item 1151.growth." if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we may fail to maintain our existing property, plant and equipment, realize our capital investment strategies, meet our growth targets and successfully expand the rate base upon which we are able to earn future returns on our investment and a return of our investment. even if we have adequate resources to make required capital expenditures, we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital expenditures on time, as a result of construction delays or other obstacles. each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we also face the risk that after we make substantial capital expenditures, the rate increases granted to us by state pucs may not be sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses and to allow us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital. the failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we own approximately 100dams. a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and property damage downstream for which we may be liable. the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates. 4 we also are required from time to time to repair or upgrade the dams that we own. the cost of such repairs can be and has been material. we might not be able to recover such costs through rates. the inability to recover these higher costs or regulatory lag in the recovery of such costs can affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. 4 the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams. federal and state agencies are currently considering rules and regulations that could require us to strengthen or dismantle one of our dams on the carmel river in california due to safety concerns related to seismic activity. any requirement to strengthen or dismantle this dam could result in substantial costs that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we are currently engaged in negotiations with federal and state agencies and local stakeholders on a plan to maintain our existing carmel river dams or to share the costs of dismantling one of them with those federal and state agencies and local stakeholders. these negotiations could be delayed or abandoned. any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation. our operating subsidiaries distribute water and wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and store water in reservoirs located across the united states. a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable. the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in theneed to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators, including state pucs with jurisdiction 31 table of contents over our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and reputation. any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates. 4 contamination of our sources of water could result in service interruptions and human exposure to hazardous substances and subject our subsidiaries to civil or criminal enforcement actions, private litigation and cleanup obligations. our water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from manmade sources, such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe, and possible terrorist attacks. in the event that our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the supply of water from another water source, including, in some cases, through the purchase of water from a thirdparty supplier. in addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. if we are unable to substitute water supply in a costeffective manner, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. we might not be able to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through rates, or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner. moreover, we could be held liable for environmental damage as well as damages arising from toxic tort or other lawsuits or criminal enforcement actions or other consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. our liquidity and earnings could be adversely affected by increases in our production costs, including the cost of chemicals, electricity, fuel or other significant materials used in the water and wastewater treatment process. font face new roman we incur significant production costs in connection with the delivery of our water and wastewater services. our production costs are driven by inputs such as chemicals used to treat water and wastewater as well as electricity and fuel, which are used to operate pumps and other equipment used in water treatment and delivery and wastewater collection, treatment and disposal. we also incur production costs for waste disposal. for 2008, production costs accounted for 11.4 of our total operating costs. these costs can and do increase unexpectedly and in substantial amounts, as occurred in california during 2001 and illinois during 2007, when the cost of electricity rose substantially. 4 our regulated businesses might not be able to recover increases in the costs of chemicals, electricity, fuel, other significant inputs or waste disposal through rates, or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner. our nonregulated businesses may not be able to recover these costs in contract prices or other terms. the inability to recover these higher costs can affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. our reliance on thirdparty suppliers poses significant risks to our business and prospects. we contract with third parties for goods and services that are essential to our operations, such as maintenance services, pipes, chemicals, electricity, water, gasoline, diesel and other materials. we are subject to substantial risks because of our reliance on these suppliers. for example - our suppliers may not provide raw materials that meet our specifications in sufficient quantities. - our suppliers may provide us with water that does not meet applicable quality standards or is contaminated. - our suppliers may face production delays due to natural disasters or strikes, lockouts or other such actions. - one or more suppliers could make strategic changes in the lines of products and services they offer. and. - some of our suppliers are small companies which are more likely to experience financial and operational difficulties than larger, wellestablished companies, because of their limited financial and other resources. 32 table of contents as a result of any of these factors, we may be required to find alternative suppliers for the raw materials and services on which we rely. accordingly, we may experience delays in obtaining appropriate raw materials and services on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities from such alternative suppliers at a reasonable price, which could interrupt services to our customers and adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. risks associated with potential acquisitions or investments may adversely affect us. we will continue to seek to acquire or invest in additional regulated water or wastewater systems, including by acquiring systems in markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses, and through tuckins. we will also continue to seek to enter into publicprivate partnerships, including oamp.m, military and design, build and operate, which we refer to as dbo, contracts and services that complement our businesses. these transactions may result in. - incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities. - failure to have or to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. - fluctuations in quarterly results. - exposure to unknown risk and liabilities, such as environmental liabilities. and. - other acquisitionrelated expenses. new roman we may also experience difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals for acquisitions, and any regulatory approvals we obtain may require us to agree to costly and restrictive conditions imposed by regulators. sales of our common stock by rwe, as well as the restrictions in the registration rights agreement between us and rwe, may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise additional equity to fund an acquisition or to issue shares as consideration in connection with an acquisition. we may not identify all significant risks when conducting due diligence for a transaction, and we could be exposed to potential liabilities for which we will not be indemnified. there may be difficulties integrating new businesses, including bringing newly acquired businesses up to the necessary level of regulatory compliance, retaining and integrating key personnel, achieving strategic objectives and integrating acquired assets and technological systems. the demands of identifying and transitioning newly acquired businesses or pursuing investment opportunities may also divert management's attention from other business concerns and otherwise disrupt our business. any of these risks may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets, causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations or require us to effect additional dilutive equity issuances. 4 our total assets include substantial goodwill. at december31, 2008, our goodwill totaled 1,699.5 million. the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of rwe in 2003 and the acquisition of e'town corporation in 2001. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and, in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no.142, "goodwill and other intangible assets," or sfas no.142, is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. annual impairment reviews are performed at november30 of each year and interim reviews are performed when management determines that a triggering event has occurred. we have been required to reflect, as required by sfas no.142 and other applicable accounting rules, a noncash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment in the amounts of 750.0 million, 509.3 million, and 227.8 million for the years ended december31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. these amounts include impairments relating to discontinued operations. as a result of these impairments, net income was reduced by 738.5 million, 501.5 million and 223.6 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 33 table of contents the company may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company's performance. these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company's stock price, a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities, the lack of an increase in the company's market price consistent with its peer companies, or decreases in control premiums and the overhang effect. a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan, such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates, could also result in an impairment charge. recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect the company's reported results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators. our regulated businesses compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, as well as strategic and financial buyers, for acquisition opportunities, which may hinder our ability to grow our business. we compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, as well as strategic and financial buyers, for acquisition opportunities, including tuckins. our competitors may impede our growth by purchasing water utilities near our existing operations, thereby preventing us from acquiring them. competing governmental entities, utilities and strategic and financial buyers have challenged, and may in the future challenge, our applications for new service territories. our growth could be hindered if we are not able to compete effectively for new territories with other companies or strategic and financial buyers that have lower costs of operations or that can submit more attractive bids. the assets of our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation through eminent domain. municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states, and organized movements may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through the governmental power of eminent domain. should a municipality or other government subdivision seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain, we may resist the acquisition. contesting an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of the affected regulated business's management from the operation of its business. 4 on september5, 2008, under threat of condemnation, california american water sold the assets of our felton, california water system, which served approximately 1,330 customers, to the san lorenzo valley water district, which we refer to as slvwd. the most recent prior sale of our water and wastewater systems under threat of condemnation occurred in 2003. if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain, there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, that we will not be able to keep the compensation, or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant onetime charges. in order to consummate the proposed rwe divestiture, we and rwe were required to obtain approvals from thirteen state pucs. there can be no guarantee that some state puc approvals already granted to us will not be appealed, withdrawn, modified or stayed. 4 to consummate the proposed rwe divestiture, we and rwe obtained regulatory approvals from state pucs in 13 states. the state puc approval in illinois has been appealed, and there can be no guarantee that the state puc approval in illinois will not be overturned. moreover, some of our existing state puc approvals may be withdrawn or altered in the future by the state pucs because they retain authority to withdraw or modify their prior decisions. there also can be no guarantee that, in conjunction with an appeal or otherwise, a stay or other form of injunctive relief will not be granted by a state puc or reviewing court. 4 in addition, two of the regulatory approvals that we and rwe obtained expire on april22, 2010 and another approval expires on april22, 2011. if rwe does not fully divest its remaining ownership of american water by 34 table of contents such dates, then we and rwe may be required to seek an extension of such approvals, as applicable, which process may result in delays, costs and the imposition of additional conditions on us or on rwe. in order to obtain the state puc approvals to consummate the proposed rwe divestiture we were required to accept certain conditions and restrictions that could increase our costs. some of the regulatory approvals contain conditions and restrictions, including reporting obligations, obligations to maintain appropriate creditworthiness, restrictions on changes of control, prohibitions on the pass through of our initial sarbanesoxley act compliance costs, prohibitions on the passthrough of certain costs of the initial public offering and related transactions, service quality and staffing level requirements and the maintenance of specific collective bargaining agreements and retirement and certain other postemployment benefit programs. these conditions and restrictions could increase our costs and adversely affect our business. our nonregulated businesses, through american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries, provide performance guarantees and other forms of financial security to our publicsector clients that could be claimed by our clients or potential clients if we do not meet certain obligations. under the terms of some of our indebtedness and some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities, other governmental entities and other customers, american water excluding its regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of the performance of our nonregulated businesses, including financial guarantees or deposits, to ensure performance of certain obligations. at december31, 2008, we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 2,288.8 million, and this amount is likely to increase if our nonregulated businesses grow. the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms. in addition, if the obligor on the instrument fails to perform certain obligations to the satisfaction of the party that holds the performance commitments that party may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit. in that event, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity could be adversely affected. we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under oamp.m contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to maintain those systems, which will negatively affect us as the operators of the systems. 4 we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under oamp.m contracts. pursuant to these contracts, we operate the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract, and it is generally the responsibility of the owner to undertake capital improvements. in some cases, we may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations. although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts, those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on us as the operator of the system and damage our reputation, and in some cases, may result in liability to the same extent as if we were the owner. our nonregulated businesses are party to longterm contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received. font face new roman some of our nonregulated businesses enter into longterm contracts pursuant to which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality's, federal government's or other party's water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities, which includes responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of those facilities, in exchange for an annual fee. our nonregulated businesses are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party. in addition, directly or through our nonregulated subsidiaries, we often guarantee our nonregulated businesses' obligations under those contracts. losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. 35 table of contents we rely on our it systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business. our it systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of our it systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and cause our results of operations to be reduced. we depend on our it systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. our it systems also allow us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain costeffective operations and provide service to our customers. our it systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from - power loss, computer systems failures and internet, telecommunications or data network failures. - operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees. - physical and electronic loss of customer data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events. - computer viruses. - intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. and - hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters. font face new roman such damages or interruptions may result in physical and electronic loss of customer or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and similar events. in addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our it systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact on the company of any of the foregoing events. in addition, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency. our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our liquidity needs. as of december31, 2008, our indebtedness including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 5,303.0million, and our working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was in a deficit position. our indebtedness could have important consequences, including - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital or capital expenditures. - exposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at a variable rate. - limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations. - likely requiring that a portion of our cash flow from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal of and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for future operations, acquisitions, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures. - limiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions. and - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt. 4 in order to meet our capital expenditure needs, we may be required to make additional borrowings under our credit facilities or be required to issue new debt securities in the capital markets. we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt capital markets or do so on favorable terms. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify, limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms. we will depend primarily on operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt. our ability to meet our expenses thus depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our 36 table of contents control. if we do not have enough money to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business that would prevent us from maintaining or increasing our business and cause our operating results and prospects to be affected adversely. our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could trigger prepayment obligations. 4 our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay or refinance on less favorable terms these borrowings before their due date. if we are forced to repay or refinance on less favorable terms these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates. in 2007, we were not in compliance with reporting covenants contained in some of the debt agreements of our subsidiaries. such defaults under the reporting covenants were caused by our delay in producing our 2006 quarterly and audited annual consolidated financial statements. we have obtained all necessary waivers under the agreements. we can provide no assurance that we will comply in the future with all our reporting covenants and will not face an event of default under our debt agreements, or that such default will be cured or waived. work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations. currently, approximately 3,700 of our employees, or approximately 51 of our total workforce, are unionized and represented by 20 different unions. approximately onefourth of our 76 union collective bargaining agreements expire annually, with 18 agreements covering 982 employees scheduled to expire before the end of 2009. we might not be able to renegotiate labor contracts on terms that are favorable to us and negotiations or dispute resolutions undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or become subject to the risk of labor actions or work stoppages. labor actions, work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may all adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. material weaknesses in the company's internal controls over financial reporting existed during 2008. if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or on a timely basis. any inability to report and file our financial results in an accurate and timely manner could harm our business and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock. as a public company, we are required to comply with the sarbanesoxley act and other rules and regulations that govern public companies. in particular, we will be required to certify our compliance with section404 of the sarbanesoxley act for the year ended december31, 2009, which requires us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. however, from 2003 until the completion of our initial public offering in april 2008, we were an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of rwe, a stock corporation incorporated in the federal republic of germany, and were not required to maintain a system of effective internal controls or comply with the requirements of the sec and the sarbanesoxley act, nor to prepare our own consolidated financial statements. as a public reporting company, we are required, among other things, to maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting suitable to prepare our publicly reported financial statements in a timely and accurate manner, and also to evaluate and report on such system of internal control. 37 table of contents a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of december31, 2006, we and our independent registered public accountants identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. - inadequate internal staffing and skills. - inadequate controls over financial reporting processes. - inadequate controls over monthend closing processes, including account reconciliations. - inadequate controls over maintenance of contracts and agreements. - inadequate controls over segregation of duties and restriction of access to key accounting applications. and. - inadequate controls over tax accounting and accruals. font face new roman each of these weaknesses could have resulted in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2008, we consider the control deficiency relating to the maintenance of contracts and agreements should remain as a material weakness until we have sufficient experience with the sustainability of the levels at which it has been operating. this weakness could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. for further discussion, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations151.our internal control and remediation initiatives." moreover, we cannot assure you that we have identified all, or that we will not in the future have additional, material weaknesses, any of which may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and cause future delays in filing our financial statements and periodic reports with the sec. any such delays in the filing of our financial statements and periodic reports may result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions imposed on us by the sec. we believe that such misstatements or delays could negatively impact our liquidity, access to capital markets, financial condition and the market value of our common stock or cause a downgrade in the credit ratings of american water or awcc. item1b. unresolved staff comments none. item2. properties our properties consist of transmission and distribution mains and conduits, water and wastewater treatment plants, pumping wells, tanks, meters, supply lines, dams reservoirs, buildings, vehicles, land, easements, rights software and other facilities and equipment used for the operation of our systems, including the collection, treatment, storage and distribution of water and the collection and treatment of wastewater. substantially all of our properties are owned by our subsidiaries, and a substantial portion our property is subject to liens of our mortgage bonds. our regulated subsidiaries own, in the states in which they operate, transmission and distribution mains, pump stations, treatment plants, storage tanks, reservoirs and related facilities. a substantial acreage of land is owned by our regulated businesses, the greater part of which is located in watershed areas, with the balance being principally sites of pumping and treatment plants, storage reservoirs, tanks and standpipes. ournonregulatedbusinesses'propertiesconsistmainlyofspreadingandwastetransportationequipment, office vehicles and furniture and are primarily located in new jersey and canada. approximately 50 of our properties are located in new jersey and pennsylvania. we lease our corporate offices, equipment and furniture, located in voorhees, new jersey from one of our whollyowned subsidiaries. these properties are utilized by our directors, officers and staff in the conduct of the business. 38 table of contents we maintain property insurance against loss or damage to our properties by fire or other perils, subject to certain exceptions. for insured losses, we are selfinsured to the extent that any losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. we believe that our properties are generally maintained in good operating condition and in accordance with current standards of good water and wastewater works industry practice and units of property are replaced as and when necessary. item3. legal proceedings in 2001, cawc, entered into a conservation agreement with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, which we refer to as noaa, requiring cawc to implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the carmel river watershed, study the removal of the san clemente dam and explore longterm water sources other than a new reservoir in the carmel river. since that time, cawc has implemented a number of measures to reduce the impact of its operations on the steelhead trout and other species and has begun the environmental review and permitting process for our coastal water project, which is intended to provide an alternate water source for the monterey peninsula and, in part, to address some of the foregoing concerns relating to withdrawals from carmel river. in early 2004, noaa informed cawc of its concern that cawc's ongoing operations would cause the "take" of significant numbers of steelhead trout during the several remaining years required to implement the coastal water project. in june 2006, cawc and noaa entered a settlement agreement whereby cawc agreed to fund certain additional projects to improve habitat conditions for and aid in the recovery of steelhead trout in the carmel river watershed. under the settlement agreement, cawc is required, among other things, to make an initial payment of 3.5 million plus six annual installments of 1.1 million. the settlement agreement requires that all payments made by cawc to noaa be used for mitigation projects in the carmel river watershed. although we established a reserve for settlement payments, no payments have been made to date because noaa had been unable to ensure that settlement payments will be used for mitigation projects in the carmel river watershed. noaa has agreed not to assess any penalties or otherwise prosecute cawc for any "take" of steelhead trout, so long as cawc complies with the settlement agreement. in january 2009, the company and noaa agreed in principle to amend the settlement agreement to allow the required payments to be made to and managed by a california state agency under an existing mitigation program. pending finalization of this amendment, including agreement by the state agency, the company expects to make its first payment of 3.5 million on april 1, 2009. on march14, 2008, the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association notified cawc of their intent to file a citizen suit, 60 days therefrom, for violations of the federal endangered species act alleging the "take" of steelhead trout by cawc along the carmel river and seeking injunctive relief to reduce river water diversions and increase river flow and fish passage facilities. no such suit was filed, however, the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association recently filed an administrative complaint with the california state water resources control board claiming that certain fish passage facilities do not meet existing permit requirements. cawc also undertakes activities to protect the threatened california redlegged frog and its habitat in the carmel river pursuant to a prior agreement with the u.s. fish and wildlife service "usfws". this agreement is currently expired, and cawc is in discussions with usfws to renew the agreement. in addition, the state water resource control board recently has held administrative hearings to address claims that cawc has exceeded its water diversion rights in the carmel river and has not diligently pursued establishing an alternative water supply as required by an administrative order issued to cawc by the state water resource control board in 1995. a decision in this matter is pending. although cawc believes it has continued to comply with its obligations under the state water resource board's 1995 order, as well as the settlement agreement and cawc's permit requirements, we can not assure you that any future requirements by the state water resources control board arising from the matters currently before it or other permit modifications would not result in material additional costs or obligations to us. 4 in february 2004, the new jersey department of environmental protection, which we refer to as njdep, issued to njawc, a notice of violation alleging that njawc had exceeded annual diversion limits contained in njaw's water allocation permits for certain wells in our lakewood system during the years 2001 through 2003. 39 table of contents njdep initially assessed a penalty of 0.6 million. njawc subsequently submitted a voluntary statewide self disclosure report identifying all such exceedances for the period of 1999 through 2003. in december 2007, njawc finalized an administrative consent order with njdep to resolve the above violations under which njawc has paid a civil fine of 0.1 million and has undertaken a 0.4 million environmental project, which we currently expect to complete by the end of 2009. we have established a reserve for the project costs, and we believe that njawc is operating in compliance with the applicable diversion limits in its water allocation permits. cawc, njawc and long island water corporation are each plaintiffs in lawsuits relating to contamination by methyl tertiary butyl ether, which we refer to as mtbe, and other gasoline additives, in which they seek to recover cleanup and treatment costs and to protect certain of their groundwater supplies. the defendants in these cases are oil and chemical companies that manufacture mtbe, refine gasoline containing mtbe, andor supply gasoline containing mtbe to retail gasoline stations. the cases were consolidated with cases involving other plaintiffs in multidistrict litigation pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in re methyl tertiary butyl ether products liability litigation , case no. mdl 1358 sas. as a result of courtordered mediation, cawc, njawc, long island water corporation and the other plaintiffs agreed to settle the lawsuits with some of the named defendants, who represent a significant portion of the total national refining capacity for mtbe. under the settlement, which was approved by the court in august 2008, cawc, njawc and long island water corporation received payments, after deducting attorneys' fees and litigation expenses, totaling approximately 15.4 million in the aggregate to treat wells that were contaminated by mtbe at the time of the settlement. the settling defendants are obligated to pay a significant share of treatment costs for any wells that become contaminated by mtbe above certain concentration levels over the next 30 years. cawc, njawc and long island water corporation expect to continue to litigate their claims against other, remaining defendants. although we do not currently expect pending and future treatment costs for mtbe contamination to be material, there can be no guarantee that cawc, njawc or long island water corporation will be able to recover all of their respective costs relating to any past or future discovery of mtbe in their wells from any of the settling defendants, by means of any pending or future litigation, or through their rate cases. terratec, our canadian subsidiary, is subject to and has been complying with an order by the ontario ministry of the environment, which we refer to as moe, issued on october31, 2006 requiring it to take steps to thicken certain biosolids that had been more susceptible to spillage during transport. moe conducted an investigation and laid charges against terratec relating to four such transport spillage incidents involving terratec that occurred prior to the issuance of the order. in december 2008, terratec and the moe agreed that terratec would pay a fine of cdn300,000 plus a 25 surcharge to resolve these charges. periodically, we are involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect our financial position or results of operations. item4. submission of matters to a vote of

this form 10k should be read as applying to all related forwardlooking statements whenever they appear in this form 10k. our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those we discuss under "risk factors" and elsewhere in this form 10k. you should read "risk factors" and "forwardlooking statements." certain 2007 and 2006 amounts have been reclassified within operations and maintenance expense to conform to the 2008 presentation. overview founded in 1886, american water is the largest investorowned united states water and wastewater utility company, as measured both by operating revenue and population served. our approximately 7,300 employees provide drinking water, wastewater and other waterrelated services to more than 15million people in 32 states and ontario, canada. in 2008, we generated 2,336.9 million in total operating revenue, representing approximately four the operating revenue of the next largest investorowned company in the united states water and wastewater business, and 186.9 million in operating loss, which includes 750.0 million of impairment charges relating to continuing operations, and a net loss of 562.4 million. 4 our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial and industrial customers. our regulated businesses that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by state pucs in the states in which they operate. the federal government and the states also regulate environmental, health and safety and water quality matters. our regulated businesses currently provide services in 20 states and in 2008 served approximately 3.3million customers, or connections to our water and wastewater networks. we report the results of this business in our regulated businesses segment. for the year ended december31, 2008 regulated businesses generated 2,082.7 million in operating revenue, prior to intersegment eliminations, representing 89.1 of our consolidated operating revenue. we also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs. our nonregulated businesses include our - contract operations group, which enters into publicprivate partnerships, including oamp.m and dbo contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for municipalities, the united states military and other customers. - applied water management group, which works with customers to design, build and operate small water and wastewater treatment plants. and - homeowner services group, which provides services to domestic homeowners to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking pipes inside and outside their homes. we report these results in our nonregulated businesses segment. for the year ended december31, 2008, our nonregulated businesses generated 272.2 million in operating revenue, prior to intersegment eliminations. 44 table of contents history new roman prior to being acquired by rwe in 2003, we were the largest publicly traded water utility company as measured by both operating revenue and population served in the united states. in 2003, we were acquired by rwe and became a private company. prior to the merger, thames us holdings, formerly an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of rwe, was the holding company for us and our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries throughout the united states and ontario, canada. the rwe acquisition resulted in certain changes in our business. for example, our operations and management were managed through thames water. our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december31, 2006 reflects expense allocations for some central corporate functions historically provided to us by thames water, including information systems, human resources, accounting and treasury activities and legal services. these allocations reflect expenses specifically identifiable as relating to our business as well as our share of expenses allocated to us based on capital employed, capital expenditures, headcount, revenues, production volumes, fixed costs, environmental accruals or other methods management considers to be reasonable. during our transition to a separate, standalone company, we have developed or obtained additional inhouse capabilities related to these functions, and therefore there were no such expense allocations in 2008 or in 2007 from rwe or its affiliates. we and rwe consider these allocations to be a reasonable reflection of our utilization of the services provided by thames water. however, our expenses as a separate, standalone company may be higher or lower than the amounts reflected in our 2006 consolidated statements of operations. also, we agreed not to file rate cases with some state pucs for specified periods of time as a condition of the acquisition. as of december31, 2007, all rate stayout provisions associated with the rwe acquisition had expired. new roman in 2005, rwe decided to divest american water. in march 2006, rwe decided to divest american water through the sale of shares in one or more public offerings. in order to become a public company once again, we have had to incur substantial initial costs, including costs associated with ensuring adequate internal control over financial reporting in order to achieve compliance with the sarbanesoxley act. these substantial initial costs will not be recovered in rates charged to our customers. see "151.our internal control and remediation initiatives." upon the completion of our initial public offering in april 2008, we again became listed on the nyse. rwe aqua holdings gmbh, the selling stockholder, sold approximately 63.2million shares of the company's common stock. rwe currently owns approximately 60 of the company's shares of common stock. we performed valuations of our goodwill in 2008, 2007 and 2006. as a result of the valuation analyses, we recorded pretax charges of 750.0 million, 509.3 million and 227.8 million, including impairment charges from discontinued operations, for the years ended december31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. our internal control and remediation initiatives font face new roman our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. however, from 2003 to april28, 2008, we were an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of rwe and, as a privately owned company, were not required to comply with the requirements of the sec and the sarbanesoxley act or to prepare our own consolidated financial statements. as a public reporting company, we are required, among other things, to maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting suitable to prepare our publicly reported financial statements in a timely and accurate manner, and also to evaluate and report on such system of internal control. in particular, we are required to certify our compliance with section404 of the sarbanesoxley act for the year ended december31, 2009, which will require us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. font 45 table of contents in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of december31, 2006, we and our independent registered public accountants identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting - inadequate internal staffing and skills. - inadequate controls over financial reporting processes. - inadequate controls over monthend closing processes, including account reconciliations. - inadequate controls over maintenance of contracts and agreements. - inadequate controls over segregation of duties and restriction of access to key accounting applications. and. - inadequate controls over tax accounting and accruals. font face new roman since joining the company in 2006, donald l. correll, our chief executive officer, and ellen c. wolf, our chief financial officer, have assigned a high priority to the evaluation and remediation of our internal controls, and have taken numerous steps to enhance these internal controls to a level that would prevent or detect a material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements and to implement an ongoing process to evaluate and strengthen our overall internal controls over financial reporting. some of the actions taken to remediate these material weaknesses and to evaluate and strengthen our other internal controls over financial reporting include. - increasing our internal financial staff numbers and skill levels, and using external resources to supplement our internal staff when necessary. - implementing detailed processes and procedures related to our periodend financial closing processes, key accounting applications and our financial reporting processes. - implementing or enhancing systems used in the financial reporting processes and monthend close processes. - conducting extensive training on existing and newly developed processes and procedures as well as explaining to employees sarbanesoxley act requirements and the value of internal controls. - enhancing our internal audit staff. - hiring a director of internal control and a director of taxes during 2007. - implementing a tracking mechanism and new policy and procedure for approval of all contracts and agreements. and. - retaining a nationally recognized accounting and auditing firm to assist management in developing policies and procedures surrounding internal controls over financial reporting, to evaluate and test these internal controls and to assist in the remediation of internal control deficiencies. font face new roman with respect to the material weaknesses described above, we believe that we have addressed the areas of material weakness, and have tested the effectiveness of controls designed to address these material weaknesses. based on these actions and the length of time these controls have been operating at a level that would prevent or detect a material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, we no longer consider these control deficiencies to be material weaknesses as of december31, 2008, except for the control deficiencies relating to the maintenance of contracts and agreements, which in our opinion should remain as a material weakness until we have sufficient experience with the sustainability of the levels at which it has been operating. as of december31, 2008, the company had incurred 58.4 million to remediate these material weaknesses and to document and test key financial reporting controls. at this time, the company cannot indicate with certainty what additional costs may need to be incurred in the future. as a condition to state puc approval of the rwe divestiture, we agreed that costs incurred in connection with our initial internal control and remediation initiatives would not be recoverable in rates charged to our customers. 46 table of contents elements of our remediation activities can only be accomplished over time, and our initiatives provide no assurances that they will result in an effective internal control environment. our board of directors, in coordination with our audit committee, will continually assess the progress and sufficiency of these initiatives and make adjustments, as necessary. the company believes the additional control procedures as designed, when implemented, will fully remediate the material weaknesses described above. factors affecting our results of operations. 4 as the largest investorowned united states water and wastewater utility company, as measured both by operating revenue and population served, our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industrywide factors, including the following - economic utility regulation. - the need for infrastructure investment. - compliance with environmental, health and safety standards. - production costs. - customer growth. - an overall trend of declining water usage per customer. - weather and seasonality and. - economic environment. since our acquisition by rwe in 2003, our results of operations have also been significantly influenced by goodwill impairments. see "goodwill impairment". font face new roman factors that may affect the results of operations of our regulated businesses' operating performance are mitigated by state pucs granting us appropriate rate relief that is designed to allow us to recover prudently incurred expenses and to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment. economic utility regulation. 4 our subsidiaries in the states in which we operate our regulated businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective state pucs. although specific authority might differ from state to state, in most states, these state pucs must approve rates, accounting treatments, longterm financing programs, significant capital expenditures and plant additions, transactions between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities, reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions, in many instances prior to their completion. regulatory policies not only vary from state to state, they may change over time. these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital. our operating revenue is typically determined by reference to the volume of water supplied to a customer multiplied by a pricepergallon set by a tariff approved by the relevant state puc. the process to obtain approval for a change in rates, or rate case, involves filing a petition with the state puc on a periodic basis as determined by our capital expenditures needs and our operating costs. rate cases and other raterelated proceedings can take several months to a year or more to complete. therefore, there is frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates. the management team at each of our regulated subsidiaries works to minimize regulatory lag. our results of operations are significantly affected by rates authorized by the state pucs in the states in which we operate, and we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with rate stayouts and delayed or 47 table of contents inadequate rate recovery. in addition to general rate case filings, we generate revenues through other cost recovery procedures. for example, some states in which we operate allow utility subsidiaries to recover system infrastructure replacement costs without the necessity of filing a full rate proceeding. since infrastructure replacement is a significant element of capital expenditures made by our subsidiaries, such programs can reduce regulatory lag. currently, pennsylvania, illinois, missouri, indiana, new york, california and ohio have allowed the use of these infrastructure surcharges. these surcharges adjust periodically based on qualified capital expenditures being completed or anticipated in a future period. these surcharges are typically reset to zero when new base rates are effective and incorporate the costs of these infrastructure expenditures. in 2008, we have been granted an additional 18.0 million in revenues, assuming constant sales volumes from such surcharges in several of our states. furthermore, we were granted a 0.6 million increase for an arsenic surcharge in our arizona subsidiary, allowing recovery for costs associated with the construction and operation of arsenic treatment facilities. 4 also, some of the states in which we operate permit passthrough provisions that allow for an increase in certain operating costs, such as purchased power and property taxes, to be passed on to and recovered from the customers outside of a general rate proceeding. some states have permitted use of some form of forecast or forwardlooking test year instead of historical data to set rates. examples of these states include hawaii, illinois, kentucky, ohio, pennsylvania, new york, tennessee and california. in addition, a number of states in which we operate have allowed the utility to update historical data for some changes that occur for some limited period of time subsequent to the historical test year. this allows the utility to take account of some more current costs or capital investments in the ratesetting process. examples of these states include new mexico, texas, missouri, iowa, virginia, maryland, west virginia, new jersey and arizona. 4 another regulatory mechanism to address issues of regulatory lag includes the ability, in some circumstances, to recover in rates a return on utility plant before it is actually in service, instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction. examples of states that have allowed such recovery include texas, pennsylvania, ohio, kentucky, virginia and california. 4 the infrastructure surcharge, passthrough provisions, the forwardlooking test year and the allowance of a return on utility plant before it is actually in service are examples of mechanisms that present an opportunity to limit the risks associated with regulatory lag. we employ each of these mechanisms as part of our rate case management program to ensure efficient recovery of our costs and investment and to ensure positive shortterm liquidity and longterm profitability. in addition, some states have permitted us to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs. in this preapproval process, the pucs assess the prudency of such projects. new roman as a condition to our acquisition by rwe in 2003, we agreed not to file rate cases in some of the states where our regulated businesses operate. in 2008 we received authorizations for additional annualized revenues from general rate cases of 187.7million. we are awaiting the final order for our hawaii general rate case that was filed in 2007, requesting 1.3 million in total additional annual revenues. in october 2008, the hawaii public utility commission approved on an interim basis an increase in additional annualized revenues of 0.7 million. the interim rates were effective for the fourth quarter of 2008. also, at this time, we are awaiting final orders in six states, for general rate cases filed in 2008, requesting additional annualized revenues of 102.7 million. there is no assurance that the filed amount, or any portion thereof, of any requested increases will be granted. marginleft4 infrastructure investment the water and wastewater utility industry is highly capital intensive. we invested approximately 1 billion and 750 million in net companyfunded capital improvements in 2008 and 2007, respectively. from 2009 to 48 table of contents 2013, we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will total between 4.0 billion and 4.5 billion. we anticipate spending between 790 million and 1.0 billion yearly on companyfunded capital investment for the foreseeable future, depending upon the timing of major capital projects. our capital investment includes both infrastructure renewal programs, where we replace existing infrastructure, as needed, and construction of new facilities to meet customer growth. from 2009 to 2013, we estimate we will invest approximately 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion to replace aging infrastructure including mains, meters, and supply and treatment facilities. we estimate that we will invest approximately 1.2 billion to 1.3 billion in new facilities to serve customer growth over this same period. in addition, we estimate that complying with water quality standards and other regulatory requirements will require approximately 300 million to 400 million of investment. projects to enhance system reliability, quality of service and risk reduction are estimated to require an investment of approximately 800 million while efficiency related projects are estimated to require an investment of approximately 400 million to 600 million over this same period. these capital investments are needed on an ongoing basis to comply with existing and new regulations, renew aging treatment and network assets, provide capacity for new growth and enhance system reliability, security and quality of service. the need for continuous investment presents a challenge due to the potential for regulatory lag, or the delay in recovering our operating expenses and earning an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital. because the decisions of state pucs and the timing of those decisions can have a significant impact on the operations and earnings of our regulated businesses, we maintain a rate case management program guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of costs of capital and utility operation and maintenance costs, including costs incurred for compliance with environmental, health and safety and water quality regulation. as discussed above under "151.economic utility regulation," we pursue methods to minimize the adverse impact of regulatory lag and have worked with state pucs and legislatures to implement a number of approaches to achieve this result, including promoting the implementation of forms of forwardlooking test years and infrastructure surcharges. compliance with environmental, health and safety standards. 4 our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal, state and local and, in the case of our canadian operations, canadian laws and regulations, governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, discharge and dispose of wastewater. these requirements include the safe drinking water act, the clean water act and similar state and canadian laws and regulations. we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. we incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety and water quality regulation to which our regulated businesses are subject. environmental, health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently, and the overall trend has been that they have become more stringent over time. we face the risk that as newer or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating expenses. in the past, we have generally been able to recover expenses associated with compliance for environmental, health and safety standards, but this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery. new roman production costs our water and wastewater services require significant production inputs and result in significant production costs. these costs include fuel and power, which is used to operate pumps and other equipment, purchased water and chemicals used to treat water and wastewater. we also incur production costs for waste disposal. for 2008, production costs accounted for approximately 11.4 of our total operating costs. price increases associated with these inputs impact our results of operations until rate relief is granted. 49 table of contents customer growth font face new roman customer growth in our regulated businesses is driven by iorganic population growth within our authorized service areas and iiby adding new customers to our regulated customer base by acquiring water and wastewater utility systems through acquisitions. generally, we add customers through tuckins of small water andor wastewater systems, typically serving fewer than 10,000 customers, in close geographic proximity to where we currently operate our regulated businesses. during 2008, 2007 and 2006, we had cash outflows of 12.5 million, 15.9 million and 12.5 million, respectively, for tuckin acquisitions of water and wastewater systems which allowed us to expand our regulated customer base. we also seek larger acquisitions that allow us to acquire multiple water and wastewater utility systems in our existing markets and markets where we currently do not operate our regulated businesses. our experienced development team evaluates potential acquisition targets across the country, particularly in highergrowth areas. before entering new markets, we will evaluate the regulatory environment to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for quality, reliability and compliance with environmental, health and safety and water quality standards. these acquisitions may include large acquisitions of companies that have operations in multiple markets. for further information, see "business151.growth." declining water usage per customer. 4 increased water conservation, including through the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers, combined with declining household sizes in the united states, has contributed to a trend of declining water usage per residential customer. additionally, in the current economic environment, both industrial and commercial usage continues to decline. the average annual decrease in residential water usage per customer from january 1999 through december 2008 as a percentage of january 1999 usage in the larger states served by our regulated businesses ranged from a decline 0.56per year in new jersey at the low end to as high as 1.62per year in west virginia. the decline in industrial and commercial usage from 2007 to 2008 was 3.7. because the characteristics of residential water use are driven by many factors, including socioeconomic and other demographic characteristics of our service areas, climate, seasonal weather patterns and water rates, these declining trends vary by state and service area and change over time. the trend of declining residential water usage per customer is higher in the predominantly rural states served by our regulated businesses. we do not believe that the trend in any particular state or region will have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations. 4 our regulated businesses are heavily dependent upon operating revenue generated from rates we charge to our customers for the volume of water they use. declining usage due to conservation or economic environment will have a negative impact on our longterm operating revenues if we are unable to secure appropriate regulatory treatment to offset the usage decline. water supply our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. drought, governmental restrictions, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. also, customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions, in particular during the summer. our water systems experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn irrigation and other outdoor uses. summer weather that is cooler and wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand, and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income. conversely, when weather conditions are extremely dry and even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers, our systems may be affected by droughtrelated warnings andor water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies, purchase supply allocation and mandatory conservation measures. all of the above conditions serve to reduce customer demand and operating revenues. these restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level 50 table of contents and may affect our service areas regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands. we employ a variety of measures to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply, both in the shortterm and over the longterm. for additional detail concerning these measures, see "business151.our regulated businesses151.overview of networks, facilities and water supply." the geographic diversity of our service areas tends to mitigate some of the effect of weather extremes. in any given summer, some areas are likely to experience drier than average weather while other areas will experience wetter than average weather. goodwill impairment at december31, 2008, the company's goodwill totaled 1,699.5 million. the company's annual impairment reviews are performed as of november30 of each year, in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company's annual strategic business plan. the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred. the company uses a twostep impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any in accordance with sfas no.142. the step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fair value for each of the company's reporting units to their respective net carrying values book values, including goodwill, on the measurement date. if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit's carrying value, then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit. the step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares, by reporting unit, the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill. the implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit's identified assets and liabilities. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit. the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit's assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date. for the november30, 2008 impairment test, the estimated fair value of the regulated reporting unit for step 1 was based on a combination of the following valuation techniques - observable trading prices of comparable equity securities of publiclytraded water utilities considered by us to be the company's peers. and - discounted cash flow models developed from the company's internal forecasts. font face new roman the estimated fair values of the nonregulated reporting units were determined entirely on the basis of discounted cash flow models. font face new roman the first valuation technique applies average peer multiples to the regulated reporting unit's historic and forecasted cash flows. the peer multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable equity securities of publiclytraded water utilities, their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for those peers. new roman the second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit's fiveyear cash flows using an estimated longterm growth rate and discounts those cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital. 51 table of contents if step 2 of the impairment test is required, the company determines the fair value of the applicable reporting unit's assets and liabilities. the fair values for the majority of such assets and liabilities are equal to their carrying values. however, the fair values of the applicable debt are highly dependent upon market conditions surrounding the measurement date. for the step 2 calculations of the fair value of debt, the company uses observable prices of instruments and indices that have risks similar to those instruments being valued, adjusted to compensate for differences in credit profile, collateral, tax treatment and call features, to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit's debt. the company has completed its november30, 2008 annual impairment review and does not believe that the company's goodwill balance was impaired. however, there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company's performance. these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company's stock price, a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities, the lack of an increase in the company's market price consistent with its peer companies, or decreases in control premiums and the overhang effect. a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan, such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates, could also result in an impairment charge. recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect the company's reported results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators. in making the determination, we considered both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the effect of the recent volatility in the equity and debt markets on the company's market capitalization. as such, the company believes that the current evaluation technique is more appropriate than relying solely on the current trading market value of the company's common stock. in reaching our conclusion, we also made certain assumptions, which we believe to be appropriate, that support the fair value of our reporting units. we considered, in addition to the listed trading price of the company's shares, the effect on that price due to rwe's majority ownership, the effect of rwe's expected disposition of its owned company shares on the market for those shares, the applicability of a control premium to our shares and certain other factors we deemed appropriate. as a result, we concluded that the company's fair value exceeds what we might otherwise have concluded had we relied on market price alone. in addition, given recent market conditions, management determined that it was appropriate for the company to consider the average of the company's closing market price over a thirty day period rather than using a particular date to calculate its market capitalization. the company's calculated market capitalization within its 2008 impairment test period was approximately 940.0 million below the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units. new roman the difference between our calculated market capitalization and the aggregate fair value of our reporting units which approximates book value resulted from the estimated control premium and the estimated impact to the company's market capitalization from the overhang created by rwe's announced plans to divest a substantial portion of its ownership through further public offerings of stock. font face new roman the estimated control premium represents the incremental premium a buyer is willing to pay to acquire a controlling, majority interest in the company. in estimating the control premium, management principally considered the current market conditions and historical premiums paid in utility acquisitions observed in the marketplace. the estimated stock overhang represents the impact on the company's share price that we believe results from investor concerns over market price dilution due to the anticipated increase in the number of the company's publicly traded shares caused by the anticipated rwe sale of the company's stock. as a condition of certain state regulator approvals for rwe's sale of the company, rwe had agreed to sell 100 of its holdings of 52 table of contents company stock by april 2010 and previously announced its intentions to reduce its interest to below 50 prior to the end of 2008. management estimated the impact of this overhang condition using reports from multiple analysts covering the company's stock and other available market information. new roman the determination of our estimated fair value required the exercise of judgment and is highly sensitive to our assumptions. our estimated fair values approximate the carrying value of reporting units leaving little estimated value in excess of the required threshold of the step 1 test. had the fair value been less than the carrying value of the reporting units, differences between the carrying value and fair value of our longterm debt which is not taken into account in step 1 but is required in step 2 would have increased any impairment charge indicated by step 1 by an estimated 300 million, due to accounting guidance that must be followed to measure the implied fair value of goodwill. 4 for the years ended december31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company recorded impairment charges for goodwill, including discontinued operations, in the amount of 750.0 million, 509.3 million and 227.8 million, respectively. as of march31, 2008, in light of the initial public offering price and trading levels in our common stock subsequent to the date of the initial public offering, the company performed an interim impairment test and, on may9, 2008, management concluded that the carrying value of the company's goodwill was impaired. the company believed that the initial public offering price was indicative of the value of the company at march31, 2008, and accordingly, based on those factors recorded an impairment charge to the goodwill of its regulated reporting unit in the amount of 750.0 million as of march31, 2008. the impairment charge was primarily attributed to the market price of the company's common stock both the initial public offering price and the price during subsequent trading being less than the estimate of the initial public offering price used during the 2007 annual test. also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the company's debt due to increased market interest rates. as a result of the impairment charge, rwe aqua holdings gmbh a whollyowned subsidiary of rwe transferred 245.0 million to the company on may13, 2008. this cash was used to reduce shortterm debt. rwe is not obligated to make any additional capital contributions. during the third quarter of 2007, as a result of the company's debt being placed on review for a possible downgrade and the proposed sale of a portion of the company in the initial public offering, management determined at that time it was appropriate to update its valuation analysis before the next scheduled annual test. based on this assessment, the company performed an interim impairment test and recorded an impairment charge to goodwill related to its regulated reporting unit in the amount of 243.3 million as of september30, 2007. the decline was primarily due to a slightly lower longterm earnings forecast caused by updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery. 4 the company completed its scheduled annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007 and determined that an impairment had occurred based upon information regarding the company's market value in connection with the initial public offering. management determined that the indicative fair value of the company based on estimates of the initial public offering price range was the best evidence of the company's market value and incorporated this indicated market value into the company's valuation methodology, which also considered other items, such as peer multiples, discounted cash flows and a control premium. based on the results of the impairment test, an impairment of 266.0 million to the company's carrying value was recognized as of december31, 2007. font face new roman the 2006 impairment charge of 227.8 million was attributable to higher interest rates in the regulated reporting unit and a change in the potential net realizable value of a nonregulated reporting unit. economic environment continued market disruption could cause a broad economic downturn. this downturn could lead to increased incidence of customers' failure to pay for services delivered as well as a decreased usage by our industrial and commercial customers. 53 table of contents

increases granted between 2006 and 2007 can be attributed to the removal of the stayout provisions and increased investment in our regulated infrastructure programs 55 table of contents comparison of results of operations for the years ended december31, 2008 and 2007 operating revenues. our operating revenues increased by 122.7 million, or 5.5, to 2,336.9 million for 2008 from 2,214.2 million for 2007. regulated businesses' revenues increased by 95.2 million, or 4.8, for 2008 compared to 2007. the nonregulated businesses' revenues for 2008 increased by 29.5 million, or 12.2, from 2007. 4 the increase in the regulated businesses' revenues was primarily due to rate increases obtained through general rate cases totaling approximately 132.8 million as well as higher revenues resulting from surcharges of 4.5 million and from customer growth and acquisitions of approximately 3.3 million. this increase was offset by a 52.3 million decrease in revenues related to lower customer consumption, mainly in our states in the midwestern region of the united states primarily due to the extremely wet weather conditions in those areas during 2008, as well as decreased usage in 2008 compared to 2007 in new jersey and pennsylvania mainly due to drier weather conditions in 2007. our nonregulated businesses' operating revenues increased by 29.5 million, or 12.2, to 272.2 million in 2008 from 242.7 for 2007. the net increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues in our contract operations group and our homeowner services group, partially offset by decreased revenues in our applied water management group and canadian fixed residuals. the increase in contract operations group revenues was primarily attributable to incremental revenues associated with design and build contracts, as well as increased military construction and oamp.m project revenues. the increase from our homeowner service group represented increased product penetration within its existing customer base. applied water management group revenues were lower than the prior year as a result of the decline in design and build activity resulting from the downturn in new home construction. the following table sets forth

revenues from industrial customers for 2008 increased 7.0 million, or 7.4, from 2007 mainly due to rate increases, offset by decreased sales volume that we believe were caused by the downturn in the economy. the volume of water sold to industrial customers decreased 2.6 billion gallons, or 5.8, from 2007. 4 water service operating revenues from public and other customers increased 8.1 million, or 3.3, from 2007 mainly due to rate increases. revenues from municipal governments for fire protection services and customers requiring special private fire service facilities totaled 104.3 million for

as additional usage requirements related to fluctuating raw water quality caused by weather conditions in some of the states in which we operate. 57 table of contents employeerelated costs including wage and salary, group insurance, and pension expense increased 42.2 million, or 9.1, for 2008 compared to 2007. these employeerelated costs represented 38.8 and 37.2 of operation and maintenance

nonregulated businesses, respectively. these increases primarily resulted from stockbased compensation expense of 3.7 million mainly attributable to the issuance of awards granted in connection with the initial public offering, 4.3 million of wages related to job reclassification of certain hourly employees for services performed and from an increase in the number of employees primarily as a result of enhancing customer service and inflationary wage rate increases. the increase in pension expense was primarily due to an increase in our regulated businesses' pension expense of 9.1 million, or 25.1, for 2008 over 2007. pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain of our regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates as contributions are made to the plans. although our pension expense calculated in accordance with sfas 87 remained relatively unchanged, pension expense increased for 2008 due to increased contributions by certain of our regulated operating companies whose costs are recovered based on the company's funding policy, which is to fund at least the minimum amount required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 which we refer to as erisa, rather than the sfas 87 expense. the increase in the contributions is attributable to a change in the discount rate and lower than expected returns on plan assets. medical benefit expenses for employees increased due to an increase in the number of employees and the rising cost of health care. other benefits increased primarily as a result of increased salaries and wages which in turn resulted in increased company contribution to the 401k and defined contribution plans. also other benefit expenses increased due to the benefit expense related to the new employee stock purchase plan. operating supplies and services include the daytoday expenses of office operation, legal and other professional services, as well as information systems and other office equipment rental charges. for 2008, these costs decreased by 10.2 million, or 3.5, compared to 2007. fortheyearsended december31, 2008 2007 increase decrease percentage in

operations group in 2008 as compared to 2007, associated with several operating contracts including a dbo project in fillmore, california. offsetting this increase were lower consulting fees associated with our remediation efforts to comply with sarbanesoxley act of 2002. these costs decreased by 58 table of contents 22.6 million to 9.4 million in 2008 from 32.0 million in 2007. other operating supplies and services were lower in 2008 as 2007 costs were higher due to a writeoff of certain deferred costs totaling 1.1 million by our new jersey subsidiary as they were no longer deemed recoverable. additionally, our nonregulated businesses recorded loss contingencies of 3.6 million in 2007. other decreases are associated with the cost of materials primarily related to our contract operations group, due to changes in project work performed. new roman maintenance materials and services, which include emergency repairs as well as costs for preventive maintenance, increased 8.3

paving costs of 1.4 million in our new jersey and missouri operating companies. the nonregulated businesses' maintenance and services expenses increased by 1.7 million as a result of higher frequency of claims, primarily resulting from the increase in the number of customer contracts, with the service line protection program in our homeowner services group, as well as from increased costs associated with the contract operations group mainly due to costs associated with new military operations and maintenance projects. customer billing and accounting expenses increased by 5.8 million,

compared to 2007. 4 other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs. these costs increased by 0.8 million, or 1.8, for 2008 compared to

table of contents insurance expense decreased due to more favorable claims experience in 2008 compared to 2007. regulatory expenses increased primarily due to writeoffs of deferred rate case expenses, primarily in tennessee, illinois, california, and ohio as well as increased rate case amortization costs associated with rate cases settled in 2007. 4 depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense increased by 3.9 million, or 1.5, for 2008 compared to 2007. this increase was primarily due to additional assets placed in service, mainly in our regulated businesses, over the last year. general taxes. general taxes expense, which includes taxes for property, payroll, gross receipts, and other miscellaneous items, increased by 15.9million, or 8.7, in 2008 compared to 2007. this increase is primarily due to increased gross receipts taxes of 7.9million primarily in new jersey and missouri and higher property tax expense of 4.2 million primarily in ohio and missouri. additionally, payroll taxes increased by 2.7 million, due to increased salaries and wages and higher payroll tax limits. gain on sale of assets. the gain on sale of assets was 0.4 million for 2008 compared to a gain of 7.3 million for 2007. the gains in 2008 and 2007 are primarily attributable to nonrecurring sales of assets no longer used in our operations. new roman impairment charge. the impairment charge was 750.0 million for 2008 compared to 509.3 million for 2007. the 2008 impairment charge was primarily due to the market price of the company's common stock both the initial public offering price and the price during subsequent trading being less than what was anticipated during our 2007 annual test. also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the company's debt due to increased interest rates. the 2007 impairment charge to goodwill to our regulated businesses was primarily due to slightly lower longterm earnings forecast caused by our updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery. see "factors affecting our results of operations151.goodwill impairment." other income deductions. interest expense, net of interest income, the primary component of our other income deductions, increased by 2.0 million, or 0.7, for 2008 compared to 2007. the increase is primarily due to increased borrowings associated with capital expenditures. offsetting the change in interest expense is an increase in afudc of 11.5 million for 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of increased construction activity in 2008 over 2007. amortization of debt expense increased 1.0 million for 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of debt restructuring. other items contributing to the change include lower miscellaneous income for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result our indiana subsidiary now accounting for certain income in operating revenues in accordance with a 2007 rate order. provision for income taxes. our consolidated provision for income taxes increased 25.0 million, or 28.8, to 111.8 million for 2008 from 86.8 million for 2007. net income loss. the net loss for 2008 was 562.4million compared to a net loss of 342.8 million for 2007. the variation between the periods is the result of the aforementioned changes. marginleft2 comparison of results of operations for the years ended december31, 2007 and 2006. 4 operating revenues. our consolidated operating revenues increased 121.1 million, or 5.8, to 2,214.2 for 2007 from 2,093.1million for 2006. an increase in operating revenues for our regulated businesses of 132.9 million in 2007 was somewhat offset by a decrease in operating revenues for our nonregulated businesses of 5.8 million. the increase in the regulated businesses' operating revenues was primarily due to rate increases of approximately 61.9 million obtained through general rate cases in new jersey, ohio, arizona, california and other states. in addition, rate increases obtained through infrastructurerelated provisions in pennsylvania, missouri, illinois and indiana totaled approximately 15.5 million. water service operating 60 table of contents revenues also increased due to growth of 0.7 in our regulated businesses' customer base through small acquisitions in our service areas and through growth in existing service areas. water sales volume associated with existing customers increased by 1.5 in 2007 compared to the prior year due to dry weather mainly in new jersey and pennsylvania. 4 the following table sets forth the

residential customers for 2007 amounted to 1,146.1 million, a 7.3 increase over 2006, primarily due to rate increases and changes in sales volume. the volume of water sold to residential customers increased by 2.9 in 2007 to 223.4 billion gallons, from 217.2 billion gallons in 2006, largely as a result of favorable weather conditions in the midatlantic states and a 0.7 increase in the residential customer base due to growth, primarily through acquisitions. 4 water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for 2007 amounted to 385.3 million, a 6.2 increase over 2006, primarily due to rate increases and changes in sales volume. the volume of water sold to commercial customers increased by 1.6 in 2007 to 93.0 billion gallons, from 91.6 billion gallons in 2006, driven by favorable weather conditions and partially offset by a decline in the number of commercial customers. water service operating revenues from industrial customers amounted to 94.7 million in 2007, a 2.9 increase over 2006, primarily due to rate increases and changes in sales volume. the volume of water sold to industrial customers increased by 0.5 in 2007 to 44.6 billion gallons, from 44.4 billion gallons in 2006. 4 water service operating revenues from public and other customers increased 17.4 million for 2007 to 247.6 million from 230.2 million for 2006, mainly due to rate increases and changes in sales volume. revenues from municipal governments for fire protection services and customers requiring special private fire service facilities totaled 99.3 million for 2007, an increase of 0.8 million over the same period of 2006. revenues generated by sales to governmental entities and resale customers for 2007 totaled 148.3 million, an increase of 16.6 million from 2006. font face new roman wastewater services 151.our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 12 states. operating revenues from these services increased by 4.7 to 75.6 million for 2007. the increase reflects a growth of 0.4 in the number of wastewater customers served but is primarily due to increases in rates charged to customers in states where we have wastewater operations principally arizona, hawaii, and new jersey. 4 our nonregulated revenues decreased by 5.8 million, or 2.3, to 242.7 million in 2007 from 248.5million for 2006. the net decline in revenues is primarily attributable to a 15.8 million decrease in 61 table of contents revenues of our contract operations group, partially offset by a 7.4 million increase in revenues of our homeowner services group, and an increase of 3.5 million from our other nonregulated businesses. the decline in revenues of our contract operations group includes the effects of having substantially completed the construction of the lake pleasant water treatment plant, a large water treatment plant in phoenix, arizona, during 2006 49.5 million of construction revenue recognized in 2006 compared to 5.2 million in 2007. pursuant to our dbo contract with the city of phoenix, we served as the lead contractor in connection with the construction of the lake pleasant facility, which includes an 80million gallonsperday surface water treatment plant and granular activated carbon reactivation system. the lake pleasant facility is significantly larger in size and function compared to other projects with which we have been engaged. however, we do not expect the completion of this project to have a material impact on our results of operations. revenues from that project were partially replaced by new contracts, including a dbo project in fillmore, california generating 12.3 million of incremental revenues and new military projects generating approximately 10.0 million of revenues. the increase from our homeowner services group represents expansion into new geographic markets virginia and trenton, new jersey. the increase in our other nonregulated businesses' revenues is due to revenues attributable to special projects in 2007. 4 operation and maintenance. our consolidated operation and maintenance expense increased by 71.9 million, or 6.1, to 1,246.5 million for 2007 from 1,174.5 million for

electricity prices, as rate freezes resulting from electricity deregulation expired in some states in which we operate. 62 table of contents employeerelated costs including wage and salary, group insurance, and pension expense increased by 44.6 million, or 10.6, for 2007 compared to 2006. these costs represented 37.2 and 35.7 of operation and maintenance expense for 2007 and 2006,

primarily resulting from an increase in the number of employees to enable service enhancements in our regulated businesses as well as wage rate increases. this increase was offset by a reduction in pension expense. pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by some of our regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates as contributions are made to the plans. the decrease is primarily attributable to lower pension expense in 2007. in addition, pension expense for 2006 included additional pension expense due to curtailment charges and a special transaction benefit charge. new roman operating supplies and services include the daytoday expenses of office operation, legal and other professional services, as well as information systems and other office equipment, facilities rental charges and other miscellaneous expenses. for 2007, these costs increased by 2.1 million or 0.7 compared to 2006. fortheyearsended december31, 2007 2006

treatment plant in phoenix, arizona. in 2006, these costs were approximately 38.7 million, compared to 4.3 million in 2007. additionally, the decrease reflects operating contracts of our nonregulated businesses that ended during 2006, and a decline in design and build activity by the applied water management group of 3.4 million due to a downturn in new home construction. offsetting these decreases were additional expenses associated with several other contracts in our nonregulated businesses, including a dbo project in fillmore, totaling 7.6 million in 2007 compared to 0.4 million in 2006, as well as increased military contract expenses of 6.1 million. also offsetting the decrease were consulting fees associated with our remediation efforts in connection with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002. these costs increased 15.1 million over 2006. office supplies and services increased as a result of increased travel as well as inflation. transportation costs increased primarily within our regulated businesses due to increased leasing costs and higher gasoline prices, amounting to approximately 3.2 million. other operating supplies and services decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned nonregulated contracts, with lake pleasant costs of 0.8 million in 2007 compared to 10.1 million in 2006 and fillmore dbo costs of 4.8 million in 2007 compared to 0.2 million in 2006. offsetting these decreases was a 2006 restatement by our indiana subsidiary of 2.4 million previously disallowed in the regulatory process. additional expenses related to the rwe divesture were 0.8 million higher for 2007 than 2006 due to higher divesture support costs. 63 table of contents maintenance materials and services, which include emergency repairs as well as costs for preventive

experienced by several of our operating subsidiaries due to winter weather conditions, increased paving costs for our new jersey, missouri, illinois and pennsylvania subsidiaries, as well as higher expenses in our nonregulated businesses, primarily the homeowner services group. customer billing and accounting expenses decreased by 16.4 million, or 30.0, for 2007 compared to 2006.

38,256 54,624 16,368 30.0 the decrease was primarily due to lower bad debt expense of 9.2 million in our regulated business and 5.8 million in our nonregulated businesses as a result of an increased focus on collection of past due accounts. other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs. these costs increased by 3.1 million, or 7.3,

42,237 3,068 7.3 insurance related expenses increased due to less favorable claims experience compared to 2006. this unfavorable variance was offset by a reduction in regulatory expenses due to the writeoff of certain deferred rate case expenses in 2006 associated with our california subsidiary. 4 depreciation and amortization. our consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased 8.1 million, or 3.1, to 267.3 million for 2007 from 259.2 million for 2006. the increase was primarily due to property placed in service, net of retirements, of 798.8 million as a result of an increased focus on infrastructure spending mainly in our regulated businesses. 64 table of contents general taxes. our consolidated general taxes expense, which includes taxes for property, payroll, gross receipts and other miscellaneous items, decreased 1.8 million, or 1.0, to 183.3 million for 2007 from 185.1 million for 2006. the decrease was primarily due to lower taxes for expatriates because employees seconded by thames water to american water were no longer employed by american water in 2007. loss gain on sale of assets. our consolidated gain on sale of assets was 7.3 million for 2007 compared to a loss of 0.1 million for 2006 due to nonrecurring sales of assets not needed in our utility operations in 2007. font face new roman impairment charges. our consolidated impairment charges were 509.3 million for 2007 and 221.7 million, excluding discontinued operations, for 2006. the 2007 impairment charges were primarily due to slightly lower longterm earnings caused by updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery as well as new information regarding our market value. the 2006 impairment charge was primarily attributable to higher interest rates in our regulated businesses and a change in the potential net realizable value of our nonregulated businesses. font face new roman other income deductions. interest expense, the primary component of our consolidated other income deductions, decreased 82.8 million, or 22.6, to 283.2 million for 2007 from 366.0 million for 2006. the decline was primarily due to the repayment of outstanding debt with new equity contributions from rwe in order to establish a capital structure that is consistent with other regulated utilities and also to meet the capital structure expectations of various state regulatory commissions. this decrease was offset slightly by higher interest expense of our regulated businesses of 9.8 million mainly due to increased borrowings to fund capital programs. 4 provision for income taxes. our consolidated provision for income taxes increased 39.9 million, or 85.1, to 86.8 million for 2007 from 46.9 million for 2006. the increase is due to higher taxable income in 2007 as compared to 2006. net income loss. our consolidated net loss including results from discontinued operations increased 180.6 million, or 111.3, to 342.8 million for 2007 from 162.2 million for 2006. the increase is the result of the changes discussed above. liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. a portion of these capital resources are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations. when necessary, we obtain funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions, including that of the water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets. if these business and market conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, we have access to revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of 850.0 million that we currently utilize to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit. see "151.credit facilities and shortterm debt." font face new roman in addition, our regulated utility subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. advances for construction are refundable for limited periods, which vary according to state regulations, as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction. utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from the rate base. generally, we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property. some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property, based on regulatory guidelines. 65 table of contents we use our capital resources, including cash, to ifund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, iipay off maturing debt, iiipay dividends, ivfund pension and postretirement welfare obligations and vinvest in new and existing ventures. we spend a significant amount of cash on construction projects that have a longterm return on investment. additionally, we operate in rateregulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time, as our recovery is subject to regulatory lag. see "business151.regulation151.economic regulation." as a result of these factors, our working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was in a net deficit position as of december31, 2008. we expect to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and cash flow from operations. we have no plans to reduce debt significantly. we rely on our revolving credit facility and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs. disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets. on september15, 2008, we sought to issue commercial paper but were unable to consummate the issuance due to adverse market conditions. in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we are borrowing under our existing 840.0 million revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire on september15, 2012. on september15, 2008, a majority of our lenders agreed to extend 685.0 million of commitments under this revolving credit facility to september15, 2013. awcc had 345.0 million of outstanding borrowings and 43.9 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 23, 2009. awcc had 178.5 million of outstanding overnight commercial paper as of february 23, 2009. we can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. as of december 31, 2008, the company had issued, through its subsidiaries, 120.3 million of variable rate demand bonds, which are periodically remarketed. we can provide no assurances that the bonds will be remarketed successfully or at reasonable interest rates. bonds totaling 24.9 million are issued by illinois american water, bonds totaling 8.6 million are issued by arizona american water and the remaining 86.9 million of bonds are issued by awcc. during the months of january and february 2009, awcc purchased its variable rate demand bonds because no buyer was willing to purchase the bonds at market rates. although buyers periodically purchased the bonds from awcc at market rates during january and february 2009, at february 23, 2009, awcc holds all 120.3 million in treasury. since the debt has been remarketed for periods no longer than one week and the company cannot be certain remarketing will be successful, the debt is included in current portion of longterm debt at december 31, 2008. new roman on february 17, 2009, the president signed the american recovery and reinvestment tax act of 2009, which we refer to as the act, into law. the act contains various tax provisions, including many that will provide benefits to the taxexempt bond market. there are provisions modifying the rules for certain classes of taxexempt bonds which may enhance the marketability of the company's tax exempt bonds. additionally, the act makes available 4billion for capitalized grants for clean water state revolving funds and 2 billion for capitalized grants under the safe drinking water act. states will reallocate these funds to subsidize eligible projects and the company intends to apply for this subsidized financing in a number of states in which it operates. since the issuance of taxexempt bonds and financing from state revolving funds is subject to governmental approvals, at this time we are not certain how much of these funds, if any, will be available to investor owned utilities. in addition, we believe we will be able to avail ourselves of the following tax provisions of the act - an extension of the bonus depreciation provisions to property placed in service in 2009. - the election to increase the carryback period for net operating losses. and. 4 there can be no assurances of our ability to take advantage of these new provisions, and any expected benefits to us are uncertain. 66 table of contents cash flows from operating activities. 4 cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of operations, are weighted toward the third quarter of each fiscal year. our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by economic utility regulation. infrastructure investment. inflation. compliance with environmental, health and safety standards. production costs. customer growth. declining per customer usage of water. and weather and seasonality. see "151.factors affecting our results of operations." font face new roman cash flows from operating activities have been a reliable, steady source of cash flow, sufficient to meet operating requirements and a portion of our capital expenditures requirements. we will seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully access such markets on favorable terms or at all. operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulatory environments or changes in our customer economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner. we can provide no assurance that our customers' historical payment pattern will continue in the future. during 2008, the company's unfunded status of its pension plan increased significantly primarily due to lower than expected 2008 asset returns, which are expected to result in increased benefit costs and required funding contributions in future years. such an increase is likely to be material to results in 2009 and subsequent years. based on current plan assets and expected future asset returns, the company currently estimates the increase to pension and postretirement expense net of capitalized amounts in 2009 to be approximately 32 million, pretax. it is the company's intent to work with pucs in the states in which it operates to minimize the impact of such increases on its results of operations. the company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 125.9 million, 132.5 million, 124.7 million, 161.9 million and 123.2 million in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates. font face new roman the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated 2008 2007 2006 in

taxes accrued including federal income, interest accrued and other current liabilities. the increase in cash flows from operations during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to increased revenues partially offset by higher contributions to our pension and postretirement healthcare trusts. 4 the increase in cash flows from operations during 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to improvements in working capital mainly driven by changes in taxes accrued and other current liabilities, slightly offset by changes in accounts receivable and unbilled utility revenues. we intend to make 128.1 million of contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit trusts during 2009. this increase was primarily caused by the impact of the significant decline in trust asset values during 67 table of contents 2009. through february 2009, we have made contributions to fund pension and other postretirement benefits of 17.1 and 10.4 million respectively. cash flows from investing

affiliates, restricted funds and investment in equity investee. font face new roman cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2008 compared to 2007 and in 2007 compared to 2006, aswe continued to increase our investment in regulated infrastructure projects. from 2009 to 2013, we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will total between 4.0 billion and 4.5 billion. we anticipate spending between 790 million and 1.0 billion yearly on companyfunded capital investment for the foreseeable future, depending upon the timing of major capital projects. we expect construction expenditures to be approximately 800 million during 2009. we intend to invest capital prudently to provide essential services to our regulated customer base, while working with regulators in the various states in which we operate to have the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment. as part of our strategy to improve operational efficiencies, we are evaluating our processes, along with the information systems associated with those processes, to optimize workflow throughout our field operations as well as streamlining our backoffice operations, as we believe are necessary and appropriate. when we make adjustments to our operations, we will incur incremental expenses, including costs to upgrade or replace outdated information systems, prior to realizing the benefit of a more efficient workforce and operating structure. we believe that increasing our operating efficiency and controlling the costs associated with the operation of our business are important to providing the quality service to our customers and communities we serve as well as to our longterm competitiveness. we are currently developing a timeline for the implementation of this strategic initiative but expect that it will span a period of three to five years. the details, including scope, cost and implementation of these solutions will not be fully known until the data gathering phase has been completed, which is targeted for december 2009. expenditures associated with this project are included in the 4.0 billion to 4.5 billion capital investment spending outlined above. 4 our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where we replace infrastructure as needed, and major capital investment projects, where we will construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities. our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors. the following table provides a summary of our historical construction expenditures. for the years ended december31, 2008 2007 2006

above were partially offset by customer advances and contributions for construction net of refunds of 3.1 million, 35.8 million, and 47.4 million for the years ended december31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. customer advances and contributions are reflected in net cash flows from financing activities. capital expenditures during the periods noted above were related to the renewal of supply and treatment assets, new water mains and customer service lines, as well as rehabilitation of existing water mains and hydrants. construction expenditures for 2008 increased by 258.0 million, or 34.4, over 2007. expenditures related to transmission and distribution increased by 123.9 million in 2008 over 2007 and meter and fire hydrant replacements increased by 44.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007. these increases occurred due to an increase in the rate of infrastructure replacement. treatment and pumping expenditures increased by 33.9 million in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of significant treatment improvements in a number of states in which we operate including kentucky, illinois and arizona. 4 on april25, 2008, the kentucky public service commission approved kentuckyamerican water company's application for a certificate of convenience and necessity to construct a 20.0million gallon per day treatment plant on the kentucky river and a 30.6 mile pipeline to meet central kentucky's water supply deficit. the kentucky project is expected to be completed by the end of 2010 with an estimated cost of 162million. construction expenditures for 2007 increased by 67.9 million, or 10.0, over 2006. the increase consisted mainly of infrastructure replacements and upgrades to treatment facilities at several plants including joplin, missouri, maricopa county, arizona, franklin township, new jersey and champaign, illinois. 4 our construction program consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where we replace infrastructure as needed, and construction of new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth. an integral aspect of our strategy is to seek growth through tuckins and other acquisitions which are complementary to our existing business and support the continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations. generally, acquisitions are funded initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from longterm debt or equity offerings. 4 we also conduct ongoing reviews of our existing investments. as a result of these reviews, we sold the operations of various nonregulated waterrelated businesses during 2006 and 2007. the following provides a summary of the major acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities in the years indicated 2008 - we paid approximately 12.5million for the acquisition of water and waste water systems. - we received approximately 12.6 million from the sale of other assets, which included 10.6 million in cash from the sale of the felton water system. in september 2008, our california subsidiary completed its sale of the felton water system to san lorenzo valley water district "slvwd". under the terms of the agreement, slvwd paid 13.4 million for the operating assets of the water system, which serves approximately 1,330 customers in felton. the payment included a 10.6million cash payment to california american water and the assumption by slvwd of 2.8million in debt. the sale of the felton system resulted in a loss on sale of 0.4 million. 2007 - we paid approximately 15.9 million for the acquisition of a number of water and wastewater systems, the largest of which was s.j. services inc., the parent company of pennsgrove water supply company, inc. and south jersey water supply company, inc. the purchase price, including acquisition costs, for s.j. services inc. was 13.5 million in cash. 69 table of contents - we received approximately 9.7 million in cash proceeds from the sale of a group of assets of the residuals business. - we received 16.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of other assets, including 13.0 million of proceeds on a property in mansfield, new jersey owned by a nonregulated subsidiary. 2006 - we paid approximately 12.5 million for the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. - we received approximately 30.2 million in cash proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations, including a group of assets of the residuals business and the underground business. our investing activities require considerable capital resources which we have generated in operations and attained through financing activities. we can provide no assurances that these resources will be sufficient to meet our expected investment needs and may be required to delay or reevaluate our investment plans. 4 during 2007, njawc, entered into an agreement with the city of trenton, new jersey to purchase the assets of the city's water system located in four surrounding townships. the agreement required approval from the new jersey puc. the initial proposed purchase price of 100.0 million was subsequently amended to 75.0 million in addition the agreement has been amended to include the provision of technical services from the city over seven years to ensure a smooth transition of ownership at a cost of 5.0 million. the administrative law judge hearing the matter has issued an initial decision approving the stipulation and sent the initial decision to the new jersey puc for consideration. on february 25, 2009, a petition seeking a referendum was filed with the city of trenton. the petition seeks to force the city council to reconsider its prior approval of the sale, and a vote as to whether the ordinance approving the sale of the system should go forward or to be negated. the company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the referendum nor can we provide assurance that the initial decision will ultimately be approved by the new jersey puc. included in the stipulation, and dependent upon final approval, the company intends to purchase finished water from the city of trenton for the next twenty years under a water supply agreement. the acquisition is expected to add approximately forty thousand customers to the company's customer base. cash flows from financing activities our financing activities whose primary purpose is to fund construction expenditures, include the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt, primarily through our whollyowned financing subsidiary, awcc. we intend to access the capital markets on a regular basis, subject to market conditions. in addition, we have received capital contributions from rwe and intend to issue equity in the future to maintain an appropriate capital structure, subject to any restrictions in the registration rights agreement between us and rwe. in order to finance new infrastructure, we received customer advances and contributions for construction net of refunds of 3.1 million, 35.8 million, and 47.4 million for the years ended december31, 2008, 2007, 2006, respectively. in february 2009, awcc completed its public offering of 75.0 million of 8.25 senior notes with a maturity date of 2038. the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay shortterm debt incurred to fund capital expenditures and general working capital purposes. new roman in may 2008, awcc issued senior notes through private placement offerings totaling 200.0 million. interest rates ranged from 6.25 to 6.55, and maturities ranged from 2018 to 2023. on may13, 2008, we received a cash equity contribution from rwe of 245.0 million. in november 2008, awcc issued 75.0 million of 10 senior notes with a maturity date of 2038 through a public offering. proceeds from the 275.0 million in debt offerings and the 245.0 million in cash equity contribution were used to repay shortterm debt incurred to fund capital expenditures and general working capital purposes. awcc issued senior notes through private placement offerings totaling 2,117.0 million during 2007. interest rates ranged from 5.39 to 6.59 and maturities ranged from seven years to 30 years. rwe made equity 70 table of contents contributions to the company amounting to 1,067.1 million and 1,194.5 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. the company used the equity contributions and proceeds from the senior notes to offset loans payable to rwe, to repay outstanding commercial paper and for other corporate purposes. new roman additionally, during september 2007, awcc issued 1,750.0 million of rwe redemption notes to rwe. the rwe redemption notes bear interest monthly at the onemonth london interbank offered rate, which we refer to as libor, plus 22.5 basis points and mature on the earliest of the following to occur amarch20, 2009, bthe date on which the company and rwe mutually agree to terminate the notes with all accrued and unpaid interest and principal becoming immediately due and payable in full, or cthe date on which rwe no longer owns more than 80 of the voting rights of the company. the company used the proceeds from the rwe redemption notes to redeem 1,750.0 million of its 5.9 mandatory redeemable preferred stock held by rwe. during october 2007, awcc issued 750.0 million in new senior notes with a term of 10 years and a fixed interest rate of 6.085 and 750.0 million in new senior notes with a term of 30 years and a fixed interest rate of 6.593. awcc used the proceeds to fund the redemption of 1,286.0 million aggregate principal amount of rwe redemption notes and 206.0 million including after tax gains of 2.2 million, net of 1.4 million of tax aggregate principal amount of rwe notes. in the second quarter of 2008, the company completed an offer to exchange fully registered 6.085 senior notes due 2017 and fully registered 6.593 senior notes due 2037 for all of its outstanding unregistered notes of the same series. the company did not receive any proceeds from the exchange offer, nor did the company's debt level change as a result of the exchange offer. the terms of the registered notes and the unregistered notes are substantially identical in all material respects. in december 2007, we used the net proceeds from the issuance of approximately 415.0 million of commercial paper and 49.0 million of excess cash to fund the repayment of approximately 464.0million of rwe redemption notes. our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy to distribute to our stockholders a portion of our net cash provided by operating activities as regular quarterly dividends, rather than retaining that cash for other purposes. our policy is to distribute 50 to 70 of our net income annually. we expect that dividends will be paid every march, june, september and december of each fiscal year to holders of record approximately 15 days prior to the distribution date. since the dividends on our common stock will not be cumulative, only declared dividends will be paid. for 2008, we paid a dividend of 0.20 per share on september2, 2008 and december1, 2008. there were no dividend payments made for 2007. subject to applicable law and the discretion of our board of directors, we will pay cash dividends of approximately 0.20 per share per quarter in 2009, to be paid approximately 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter. the quarterly and annual average aggregate dividend amounts for the four quarters would be 34.3 million, and 137.1 million annually. the aggregate dividend amounts are based upon the estimated average 171.3million shares outstanding during the next four quarters. under delaware law, our board of directors may declare dividends only to the extent of our "surplus" which is defined as total assets at fair market value minus total liabilities, minus statutory capital or, if there is no surplus, out of our net profits for the then current andor immediately preceding fiscal year. although we believe we will have sufficient net profits or surplus to pay dividends at the anticipated levels during the next four quarters, our board of directors will seek periodically to assure itself of this before actually declaring any dividends. in future periods, our board of directors may seek opinions from outside valuation firms to the effect that our solvency or assets are sufficient to allow payment of dividends, and such opinions may not be forthcoming. if we sought and were not able to obtain such an opinion, we likely would not be able to pay dividends. new roman on february 6, 2009, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of 0.20 per share payable on march 2, 2009 to all shareholders of record as of february 18, 2009. 71 table of contents the following longterm debt

credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. on december31, 2008, our ratio was 0.56 and therefore we were in compliance with the ratio. the weighted average interest rate on shortterm borrowings for the year ended december31, 2008 and december31, 2007 was approximately 3.51 and 5.49, respectively. 74 table

from financing activities". the capital structure at december31, 2008 more closely reflects our expected future capital structure. 4 as a condition to some puc approvals of the rwe divestiture, we agreed to maintain a capital structure with a minimum of 45 common equity at the time of the consummation of our initial public offering on april28, 2008. as a result of the impairment charges recorded for the three months ended march31, 2008, our capital structure did not meet this minimum requirement and we received a cash equity contribution from rwe of 245.0 million on may1, 2008. this cash was used to repay 243.4 million of shortterm debt. contributions from rwe were 1,067.1 million for the year ended december31, 2007. rwe is not obligated to make any additional capital contributions. debt covenants. 4 our debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants. to the extent that we are not in compliance, we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends, issue debt or access our revolving credit lines. we were in compliance with our covenants as of december31, 2008. see "risk factors151.risks related to our industry and business151.our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could trigger repayment obligations." longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, limit, subject to certain exceptions, the company from issuing debt secured by the company's assets. certain long term notes required the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. in addition, the company has 1,104.9 million of notes which include the right to redeem the notes in whole or in part from time to time subject to certain restrictions. new roman security ratings our access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets depend on the securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets. we primarily access the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through awcc. however, we do issue debt at our regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of tax exempt securities, to lower our overall cost of debt. the following table shows the company's securities ratings as of december31, 2008. securities moody'sinvestors service standardamp.poor's ratings service senior unsecured debt baa2 bbb commercial paper p2 a2 75 table of contents on june19, 2008, standardamp. poor's ratings services, which we refer to as samp.p, downgraded the senior unsecured issuer rating of awcc to "bbb" stable outlook from "a" negative outlook. in addition, samp.p assigned a "bbb" corporate credit rating to american water and affirmed awcc's "a2" shortterm rating. on november 14, 2008, samp.p affirmed its "bbb" corporate credit rating on awcc and american water. on january 16, 2009, samp.p assigned its "bbb" unsecured debt rating to awcc 75.0 million senior unsecured monthly notes due december1, 2038. on august28, 2007, moody's investors service, which we refer to as moody's, placed both the longterm and shortterm ratings of awcc on review for possible downgrade. on october12, 2007, moody's downgraded the senior unsecured issuer rating of awcc to "baa2" from "baa1." in addition, moody's assigned a "baa2" senior unsecured issuer rating to american water and affirmed awcc's "p2" shortterm rating. the rating outlook for both american water and awcc is stable. 4 a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows from financing and operating activities in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans. we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flow is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings. new roman none of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facilities. 4 as part of the normal course of business, we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, fuels and other services. these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. depending on its net position with a counterparty, the demand could be for the posting of collateral. in the absence of expressly agreed provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, the obligation to supply the collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the company's situation at the time of the demand. if we can reasonably claim that we are willing and financially able to perform our obligations, it may be possible to successfully argue that no collateral should be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months of future payments should be sufficient. we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operation, financial position or cash flows. recent market conditions. 4 the company believes it has sufficient liquidity despite the current disruption of the capital and credit markets. the company funds liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations, public and private debt offerings, commercial paper markets and credit facilities with 850.0 million in aggregate total commitment from a diversified group of banks and we had 281.8 million available as of february 23, 2009. the company closely monitors the financial condition of the financial institutions associated with its credit facilities. 4 the company's retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. changes to the retirement trust asset value can impact the company's pension and other benefits expense, funded status and future minimum funding requirements. our risk is reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates. in addition, pension and other benefits liabilities decrease as fixed income asset values decrease fixed income yields rise since the rate at which we discount pension and other retirement trust asset future obligations is highly correlated to fixed income yields. during 2008 the market value of our pension 76 table of contents and postretirement benefit trust assets declined by 171.9 million. the company performed an assetliability study on its pension and postretirement benefit trust assets, and changed the asset allocation from 60 equities and 40 fixed income to 70 equities and 30 fixed income. this new investment allocation was implemented in december 2008. additionally a reduction in fixed income yields rate used to discount obligations at the end of 2008 caused an increase to pension and postretirement benefit liabilities. the reduction of asset values combined with an increase in pension and postretirement benefit liabilities will constitute an increase to pension and postretirement benefit costs net of capitalized amounts of approximately 32.0 million during 2009 compared to 2008. the company also assessed the impact of the severe liquidity crises at major financial institutions on the company's ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms. on september15, 2008, the company was unable to access shortterm liquidity through its a2p2 rated commercial paper program. the company therefore utilized its credit facilities to repay maturing commercial paper and fund its shortterm liquidity needs. although the company's credit facility syndicate banks are currently meeting all of their lending obligations, there can be no assurance that these banks will be able to meet their obligations in the future if the liquidity crises intensify or are protracted. 4 as of december 31, 2008, the company had issued, through its subsidiaries, 120.3 million of variable rate demand bonds, which are periodically remarketed. we can provide no assurances that the bonds will be remarketed successfully or at reasonable interest rates. bonds totaling 24.9 million are issued by illinois american water, bonds totaling 8.6 million are issued by arizona american water and the remaining 86.9 million of bonds are issued by awcc. during the months of january and february 2009, awcc purchased its variable rate demand bonds because no buyer was willing to purchase the bonds at market rates. although buyers periodically purchased the bonds from awcc at market rates during january and february 2009, awcc holds all 120.3 million in treasury at february 23, 2009. since the debt has been remarketed for periods no longer than one week and the company cannot be certain remarketing will be successful, the debt is included in current portion of longterm debt at december 31, 2008. at this time the company does not believe recent market disruptions will impact its longterm ability to obtain financing. the company expects to have access to liquidity in the capital markets on favorable terms before the maturity dates of its current credit facilities and the company does not expect a significant number of its lenders to default on their commitments thereunder. in addition, the company can delay major capital investments or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity, if necessary. the company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time. regulatory restrictions the issuance by the company or awcc of longterm debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state puc if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized. however, state puc authorization is required to issue longterm debt or equity securities at most regulated subsidiaries. our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing. under applicable law, our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. a significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the dividends that these companies can distribute to us. insurance coverage. 4 we carry various property, casualty and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions consistent with industry standards. however, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover 77 table of contents unanticipated losses or claims. we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. such losses could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm and longterm financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows. new roman contractual obligations and commitments we enter into obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of business.

4 from 1997 through 2002, wvawc, entered into a series of agreements with various public entities, which we refer to as the partners, to establish certain joint ventures, commonly referred to as "publicprivate partnerships." under the publicprivate partnerships, the wvawc constructed utility plant, financed by the wvawc, and the partners constructed utility plant connected to the wvawc's property, financed by the 78 table of contents partners. wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds "idbs", issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act. wvawc leased back the total facilities, including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners, under leases for a period of 40 years. wvawc leased back the transferred facilities under capital leases for a period of 40 years. the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs. in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation number 39, offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts, we have presented the transaction on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements. the carrying value of the transferred facilities was approximately 161.0 million at december31, 2008. font face new roman nonregulated businesses performance obligations our nonregulated businesses contract operations group enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military, municipalities and other customers. these military services agreements expire between 2053 and 2059 and have remaining performance of 1,185.0 million at december31, 2008. the operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2009 and 2038 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of 1,103.8 million and 1,178.8 million at december31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. some of the company's longterm contracts to operate and maintain a municipality's, federal government's or other party's water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities, in exchange for an annual fee. font face new roman included in the military services performance commitment at december31, 2008 are contracts operations group was awarded during september 2008 for operation and maintenance of the water

348.0 million, respectively, over a 50year period as measured by gross contract revenue subject to price redeterminations and customary federal contracting termination provisions. federal contract price redetermination is a mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in subsequent periods to reflect changes in contract obligations and market conditions. critical accounting policies and estimates. 4 the application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates, assumptions and other judgments. although our management believes that these estimates, assumptions and other judgments are appropriate, they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 4 our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them, with our audit committee. in addition, our management has also reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee. regulatory accounting. 4 our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state pucs and the local governments of the states in which they operate. as such, we account for these regulated operations in accordance with sfas no.71, "accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation," which we refer to as sfas no.71, which requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our financial statements. use of sfas no.71 is applicable 79 table of contents to utility operations that meet the following criteria 1thirdparty regulation of rates. 2costbased rates. and 3a reasonable assumption that all costs will be recoverable from customers through rates. as of december31, 2008, we had concluded that the operations of our regulated subsidiaries meet the criteria. if it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of the businesses no longer meets the criteria, we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. failure to meet the criteria of sfas no.71 could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as a onetime extraordinary item and through impacts on continuing operations. regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow for recovery through rates charged to customers. regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred. as of december31, 2008, we have recorded 919.7 million of net regulatory assets within our consolidated financial statements. also, at december31, 2008, we had recorded 307.3 million of regulatory liabilities within our consolidated financial statements. see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the significant regulatory assets. for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business, we continually assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement. this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory environments, recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction, the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation and the ability to recover costs through regulated rates. marginleft2 goodwill the company's annual impairment reviews are performed as of november30 of each year, in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company's annual strategic business plan. at december31, 2008, the company's goodwill was 1,699.5 million. the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred. 4 the company uses a twostep impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any in accordance with sfas no.142. the step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fair value for each of the company's reporting units to their respective net carrying values book values, including goodwill, on the measurement date. if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit's carrying value, then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit. the step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares, by reporting unit, the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill. the implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit's identified assets and liabilities. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit. 4 the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit's assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date. 4 for the november30, 2008 impairment test, the estimated fair value of the regulated reporting unit for step1 was based on a combination of the following valuation techniques - observable trading prices of comparable equity securities of publiclytraded water utilities considered by us to be the company's peers. and - discounted cash flow models developed from the company's internal forecasts. font 80 table of contents the estimated fair values of the nonregulated reporting units were determined entirely on the basis of discounted cash flow models. the first valuation technique applies average peer multiples to the regulated reporting unit's historic and forecasted cash flows. the peer multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable equity securities of publiclytraded water utilities, their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for those peers. the second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit's fiveyear cash flows using an estimated longterm growth rate and discounts these cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital. if step 2 of the impairment test is required, the company determines the fair value of the applicable reporting unit's assets and liabilities. the fair values for the majority of such assets and liabilities are equal to their carrying values. however, the fair values of the applicable debt are highly dependent upon market conditions surrounding the measurement date. for the step 2 calculations of the fair value of debt, the company uses observable prices of instruments and indices that have risks similar to those instruments being valued, adjusted to compensate for differences in credit profile, collateral, tax treatment and call features, to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit's debt. font face new roman the company has completed its november30, 2008 annual impairment review and does not believe that the company's goodwill balance was impaired. however, there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company's performance. these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company's stock price, a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities, the lack of an increase in the company's market price consistent with its peer companies, or decreases in control premiums and the overhang effect. a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan, such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates, could also result in an impairment charge. recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect the company's reported results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators. in making the determination, we considered both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the effect of the recent volatility in the equity and debt markets on the company's market capitalization. as such, the company believes that the current valuation technique is more appropriate than solely relying on the current trading market value of the company's common stock. in reaching our conclusion, we also made certain assumptions, which we believe to be appropriate, that support the fair value of our reporting units. we considered, in addition to the listed trading price of the company's shares, the effect on that price due to rwe's majority ownership, the effect of rwe's expected disposition of its owned company shares on the market for those shares, the applicability of a control premium to our shares and certain other factors we deemed appropriate. as a result, we concluded that the company's fair value exceeds what we might otherwise have concluded had we relied on market price alone. in addition, given recent market conditions, management determined that it was appropriate for the company to consider the average of the company's closing market price over a thirty day period rather than using a particular date to calculate its market capitalization. the company's calculated market capitalization within its 2008 impairment test period was approximately 940.0 million below the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units. 4 the difference between our calculated market capitalization and the aggregate fair value of our reporting units which approximates book value resulted from the estimated control premium and the estimated impact to the company's market capitalization from the overhang created by rwe's announced plans to divest a substantial portion of its ownership through further public offerings of stock. 81 table of contents the estimated control premium represents the incremental premium a buyer is willing to pay to acquire a controlling, majority interest in the company. in estimating the control premium, management principally considered the current market conditions and historical premiums paid in utility acquisitions observed in the marketplace. 4 the estimated stock overhang represents the impact on the company's share price that we believe results from investor concerns over market price dilution due to the anticipated increase in the number of the company's publicly traded shares caused by the anticipated rwe sale of the company's stock. as a condition of certain state regulator approvals for rwe's sale of the company, rwe had agreed to sell 100 of its holdings of company stock by april 2010 and previously announced its intentions to reduce its interest to below 50 prior to the end of 2008. management estimated the impact of this overhang condition using reports from multiple analysts covering the company's stock and other available market information. the determination of our estimated fair value required the exercise of judgment and is highly sensitive to our assumptions. our estimated fair values approximate the carrying value of reporting units leaving little estimated value in excess of the required threshold of the step 1 test. had the fair value been less than the carrying value of the reporting units, differences between the carrying value and fair value of our longterm debt which is not taken into account in step 1 but is required in step 2 would have increased any impairment charge indicated by step 1 by an estimated 300 million, due to accounting guidance that must be followed to measure the implied fair value of goodwill. 4 for the years ended december31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company recorded impairment charges for goodwill, including discontinued operations, in the amount of 750.0 million, 509.3 million and 227.8 million, respectively. as of march31, 2008, in light of the initial public offering price and trading levels in our common stock subsequent to the date of the initial public offering, the company performed an interim impairment test and, on may9, 2008, management concluded that the carrying value of the company's goodwill was impaired. the company believed that the initial public offering price was indicative of the value of the company at march31, 2008, and accordingly, based on those factors recorded an impairment charge to the goodwill of its regulated reporting unit in the amount of 750.0 million as of march31, 2008. the impairment charge was primarily attributed to the market price of the company's common stock both the initial public offering price and the price during subsequent trading being less than the estimate of the initial public offering price used during the 2007 annual test. also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the company's debt due to increased market interest rates. as a result of the impairment charge, rwe aqua holdings gmbh a whollyowned subsidiary of rwe transferred 245.0 million to the company on may13, 2008. this cash was used to reduce shortterm debt. rwe is not obligated to make any additional capital contributions. during the third quarter of 2007, as a result of the company's debt being placed on review for a possible downgrade and the proposed sale of a portion of the company in the initial public offering, management determined at that time it was appropriate to update its valuation analysis before the next scheduled annual test. based on this assessment, the company performed an interim impairment test and recorded an impairment charge to goodwill related to its regulated reporting unit in the amount of 243.3 million as of september30, 2007. the decline was primarily due to a slightly lower longterm earnings forecast caused by updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery. 4 the company completed its scheduled annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007 and determined that an impairment had occurred based upon information regarding the company's market value in connection with the initial public offering. management determined that the indicative fair value of the company based on estimates of the initial public offering price range was the best evidence of the company's market value and incorporated this indicated market value into the company's valuation methodology, which also considered other items, such as peer multiples, discounted cash flows and a control premium. based on the results of the impairment test, an impairment of 266.0 million to the company's carrying value was recognized as of december31, 2007. 82 table of contents the 2006 impairment charge of 227.8 million was attributable to higher interest rates in the regulated reporting unit and a change in the potential net realizable value of a nonregulated reporting unit. impairment of longlived assets longlived assets, other than goodwill which is discussed above, include land, buildings, equipment and longterm investments. longlived assets, other than investments and land are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition, or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. in addition, changes in the expected useful life of these longlived assets may also be an impairment indicator. when such events or changes occur, we estimate the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the assets, and compare that to the carrying value of the asset. if the carrying value is greater than the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value. the key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume, rates, operating costs, labor and other benefit costs, capital additions, assumed discount rates and other economic factors. these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and, thus, could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements. font face new roman the longlived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable. new roman the fair values of longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets. in assessing potential impairment for these investments, we consider these factors. if such assets are considered impaired, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value. as a result of fair value analyses, we recorded pretax charge of 0 for the years ended december31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and 0.8 million for the year ended december31, 2006. new roman revenue recognition revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the latest meter reading to the end of the accounting period. unbilled revenues as of december31, 2008 and 2007 were 134.2 million and 134.3 million, respectively. increases in volumes delivered to the utilities' customers and favorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the estimated unbilled revenue. however, since the majority of our customers are billed on a monthly basis, total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged. revenue from nonregulated operations is recognized as services are rendered. revenues from certain construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the estimated percentage of completion during the period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract. losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable. revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue. billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the 83 table of contents balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met. changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. accounting for income taxes. 4 the parent company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for united states tax purposes. members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns. certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. the company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements. these deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. in addition, the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences, previously flowed through to customers, reverse. marginleft2 accounting for pension and postretirement benefits font face new roman we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations. the pension plans have been closed for any employees hired on or after january1, 2006. union employees hired on or after january1, 2001 and nonunion employees hired on or after january1, 2006 will be provided with a 5.25 of base pay defined contribution plan. we also maintain postretirement benefit plans for eligible retirees. the retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after january1, 2006. the plans had previously closed for nonunion employees hired on or after january1, 2002. we follow the guidance of sfas 87, "employers' accounting for pensions," and sfas 106, "employers' accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions," when accounting for these benefits. in addition, we adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of sfas 158, "employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans," effective december31, 2006. see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans. accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, the rate of future compensation increases received by the company's employees, mortality, turnover and medical costs. each assumption is reviewed annually. the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes. the primary assumptions are - discount rate151.the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. the objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due. - expected return on plan assets151.management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily based upon the plans' mix of assets and expectations for the longterm returns on those asset classes. these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs we record currently. - rate of compensation increase151.management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. and - health care cost trend rate151.management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care. 84 table of contents in selecting a discount rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans, a yield curve was developed for a portfolio containing the majority of united statesissued aagraded noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions corporate bonds. for each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 6.12 and 6.27 at december31, 2008 and 2007 respectively. the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 6.09 and 6.20 at december31, 2008 and 2007 respectively. the discount rate for determining both the pension obligations and other postretirement benefit obligations was 5.90 at december31, 2006. the asset allocation for the company's u.s. pension plan at december31, 2008 and 2007 by asset category, are as follows target

welfare plan trusts investments include debt and equity securities held directly and through commingled funds. the trustee for the company's defined benefit pension and post retirement welfare plans uses independent valuation firms to calculate the fair value of plan assets. additionally, the company independently verifies the assets values. approximately 87.2 of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date. the remaining 12.8 of the assets are valued using other observable inputs. 4 in selecting an expected return on plan assets, we considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans. the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets, which we refer to as eroa, assumption used in calculating pension cost was 7.90 for 2008, 8.00 for 2007, and 8.25 for 2006. the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 7.75 for 2008, 7.38 for 2007, and 7.95 for 2006. 85 table of contents in selecting a rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. our rate of compensation increase was 4.00 for 2008, and 4.25 for 2007 and 2006. in selecting health care cost trend rates, we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. our health care cost trend rate used to calculate the periodic cost was 8.00 in 2008 gradually declining to 5 in 2014 and thereafter. 4 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. the health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions. a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects. change in actuarial assumption impact on other postretirement benefitobligationat december31,2008 impacton2008 total service and interestcost components in thousands increase assumed health care cost trend by 1 59,525 6,226 decrease assumed health care cost trend by 1 49,853 5,100 we will use a discount rate and eroa of 6.12 and 7.90, respectively, for estimating our 2009 pension costs. additionally, we will use a discount rate and expected return on plan assets of 6.09 and 7.60, respectively, for estimating our 2009 other postretirement benefit costs. a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increases our pension expense. our 2008 and 2007 pension and postretirement costs were 51.4 million and 44.9 million, respectively. based on current plan assets and expected future asset returns, the company currently estimates the increase to pension and postretirement expense net of capitalized amounts in 2009 to be approximately 32 million, pretax. it is the company's intent to work with pucs in the states in which it operates to minimize the impact of such increases on its results of operations. the company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 125.2 million, 132.5 million, 124.7 million, 161.9 million and 123.2 million in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates. the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards. the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. as these assumptions change from period to period, recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change. recent accounting pronouncements. 4 in january 2009, the financial accounting standards board "fasb" issued fasb staff position "fsp". emerging issues task force "eitf" no. 99201, "amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no. 9920" "fsp eitf 99201". this pronouncement amends eitf 9920. "recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets." eitf 9920, to achieve more consistent determination of whether an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred. fsp eitf 99211 also retains and emphasizes the objective of an other thantemporary impairment assessment and the related disclosure requirements in sfas no. 115 "accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities," and other related guidance. fsp eitf 99201 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december 15, 2008, and is required to be applied prospectively. the adoption of fsp eitf 99201 did not have an impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. in december 2008, the fasb issued fas no. 132r1, "employers" disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets" "fsp fas 132r1", which requires additional disclosures for employers' pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets. as pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were not included within the scope of sfas no. 157, fsp fas 132r1 requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets similar to the disclosures required under sfas no. 157, the investment policies and strategies for the major categories of plan assets, and significant concentrations of risk within plan 86 table of contents assets. fsp fas 132r1 will be effective for the registrants as of december 31, 2009. as fsp fas 132r1 provides only disclosure requirements, the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. on october10, 2008, fasb issued fasb staff position no.1573, "determining the fair value of a financial asset when a market for that asset is not active" "fsp 1573", which clarifies the application of statement of financial accounting standards no.157, "fair value measurements" sfas 157" in an inactive market and provides an example to demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive. fsp 1573 was effective upon issuance, including prior periods of which financial statements had not been issued. the adoption of this standard as of september30, 2008 did not have an impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. infebruary 2008, the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas1572 which allows a oneyear deferral of the adoption of sfas 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities such as intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and goodwill that are required to be measured at fair value on a periodic basis such as at acquisition or impairment. the company elected to use this deferral option and accordingly, only partially adopted sfas 157 on january1, 2008. sfas 157 will be adopted for the company's nonfinancial assets and liabilities valued on a nonrecurring basis on january1, 2009. in september 2006, the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no.157, "fair value measurements," which we refer to as sfas 157. sfas 157 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles guidance requiring use of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. on january1, 2008, the company adopted the provisions of sfas 157 for financial assets and liabilities, and nonfinancial assets and liabilities with recurring measurements. the company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period were cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds and shortterm debt. these assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on the balance sheet date using quoted prices in active markets level 1 inputs, as defined by sfas 157. the adoption of sfas 157 for the company's financial assets and liabilities did not have a material effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. the company measured the assets of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement welfare plans pursuant to sfas 157 as of december31, 2008. the company does not believe the adoption of sfas 157 for the company's nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have an impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. new roman in december 2007, the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no.160, "noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements151.an amendment of arb no.51," which we refer to as sfas160. sfas 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. sfas 160 will be effective for us on january1, 2009. we do not believe this standard will have an impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. also in december 2007, the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no.141r, "business combinations," which we refer to as sfas141r. sfas141r, which will significantly change the accounting for business combinations, is effective for business combinations finalized on or after january1, 2009. as the provisions of sfas 141r are applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs after the guidance becomes effective, the impact to the company cannot be determined until the transactions occur. in december 2008, the company expensed transaction costs of approximately 0.9 million for acquisitions that will not close until after january1, 2009 and will not be capitalized as goodwill under the provisions of sfas 141r. in february 2007, the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no.159, "the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities151.including an amendment of fasb statement no.115," "sfas 159". this standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without 87 table of contents having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. sfas 159 is effective for years beginning january1, 2008. the company has not elected to exercise the fair value irrevocable option. therefore, the adoption of sfas 159 did not have an impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 4 in september 2006, the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no.158, "employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans151.an amendment of fasb statements no.87, 88, 106 and 132r," which we refer to as sfas 158. this statement requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. under sfas 158, actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition obligations and assets that have not been recognized in net periodic benefit cost under previous accounting standards will be recognized as a regulatory asset for the portion of the underfunded liability that meets the recovery criteria prescribed in sfas 71 and as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, for that portion of the underfunded liability that does not meet sfas 71 regulatory accounting criteria. we adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of the statement on december31, 2006. 4 in september 2006, the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no.108, "considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements," which we refer to as sab 108. sab 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year's financial statements are materially misstated. sab 108 was effective for the fiscal year ended december31, 2006. font face new roman in june 2006, the fasb issued interpretation no.48, "accounting for uncertainty in income taxes," which we refer to as fin 48, an interpretation of sfas no.109, "accounting for income taxes." fin 48 is intended to address inconsistencies among entities with the measurement and recognition in accounting for income tax deductions for financial statement purposes. specifically, fin 48 addresses the timing of the recognition of income tax benefits. fin 48 requires the financial statement recognition of an income tax benefit when we determine that it is morelikelythannot that the tax position will be sustained. fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december15, 2006. we adopted it as required on january1, 2007, and it did not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position. font face new roman during 2006, the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board ratified eitf issue no.063, "how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is, gross versus net presentation," which we refer to as eitf 063. the task force reached a consensus that the scope of eitf 063 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction between a seller and a customer, and that the presentation of such taxes is an accounting policy that should be disclosed. our accounting policy is to present these taxes on a net basis excluded from revenues. see note 2151.significant accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards recently adopted or pending adoption. item7a. quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk new roman we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. we use a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt to reduce interest rate exposure. as of december31, 2008, a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates associated with variablerate debt would result in a 0.2million decrease in our pretax earnings. our risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are reduced through longterm contracts and the ability to recover price increases through rates. nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 88 table of contents our common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange on april23, 2008. the market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations, many of which are unrelated to our operating performance. in particular, our stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry. these could include, among other things, interest rate movements, quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions. this volatility may make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock, regardless of our financial performance, and such difficulty may preclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations. we are exposed to credit risk through our water, wastewater and other waterrelated activities for both our regulated and nonregulated businesses. our regulated businesses serve residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers while our nonregulated businesses engage in business activities with developers, government entities and other customers. our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer account receivable balances. our credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements. our credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations. in addition, our regulated businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates. we are also exposed to a potential national economic recession or further deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. the credit quality of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes. in addition, as a result of the downturn in the economy and heightened sensitivity of the impact of additional rate increases on certain customers, there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations. therefore our ability to fully recover operating expense, recover our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our regulated businesses may be adversely impacted. item8. financial statements and supplementary data 89

of contents american water works company, inc. and subsidiary companies notes to consolidated financial statements new roman in thousands, except per share data note 1 organization and operation. 4 american water works company, inc. "aww" and its subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as the "company" is the holding company for regulated and nonregulated subsidiaries throughout the united states of america and ontario, canada. the regulated subsidiaries provide water and wastewater services and, as public utilities, function under rules and regulations prescribed by state regulators. these regulated subsidiaries have similar longterm economic characteristics and are operationally segregated into the 20 u.s. states in which the company operates regulated utilities. the nonregulated subsidiaries include distinctive lines of business including homeowner services, which provides water and sewer line protection plans for homeowners, the operations and maintenance contracts group, which conducts operation and maintenance of water and wastewater facilities for municipalities and the u.s. military, among others, and carbon regeneration, which sells granular activated carbon technologies to help remove contaminants and improve the quality of drinking water. the company is a majorityowned subsidiary of rwe aktiengesellschaft "rwe" see note 9. note 2 significant accounting policies principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of aww and its subsidiaries. intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries have been eliminated. the company uses the equity method to report its investments in two joint venture investments in each of which the company holds a 50 voting interest and cannot exercise control over the operations and policies of the investments. under the equity method, the company records its interests as an investment and its percentage share of earnings as earnings or losses of investee. use of estimates font face new roman the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from these estimates. the company considers benefit plan assumptions, the carrying values of goodwill and other longlived assets, including regulatory assets, revenue recognition and accounting for income taxes to be its critical accounting estimates. the company's significant estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for pension and other postemployment benefits, contingencyrelated obligations and goodwill. regulation the company's regulated utilities are subject to regulation by the public utility commissions and the local governments of the states in which they operate the "regulators". these regulators have allowed recovery of costs and credits which the company has recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. accounting for future recovery of costs and credits as regulatory assets and liabilities is in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no.71, "accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation" "sfas 71". this statement sets forth the application of generally accepted accounting principles for those companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent thirdparty regulator. under sfas 71, regulated utilities defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in operations by an nonregulated company. these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then reflected in the statement of operations in the period in which the costs and credits are reflected in the rates charged for service. 98 table of contents property, plant and equipment font face new roman property, plant and equipment consist primarily of utility plant. additions to utility plant and replacements of retirement units of property are capitalized. costs include material, direct labor and such indirect items as engineering and supervision, payroll taxes and benefits, transportation and an allowance for funds used during construction. the costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. the carrying value of these costs amounted to 35,971 and 29,103 at december31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. the cost of repairs, maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities, and minor replacements of property is charged to maintenance expense as incurred. when units of property are replaced, retired or abandoned, the recorded value thereof is credited to the asset account and charged to accumulated depreciation. to the extent the company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory asset is recorded. in some cases, the company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. these amounts result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through customer rates, until the costs to retire those assets are incurred. the cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straightline average remaining life method. nonutility property consists primarily of buildings and equipment utilized by the company for internal operations. this property is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to fifty years. cash and cash equivalents substantially all cash is invested in interestbearing accounts. all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents. font face new roman the company had book overdrafts for certain of its disbursement accounts of 42,010 and 42,198 at december31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. a book overdraft represents transactions that have not cleared the bank accounts at the end of the period. the company transfers cash on an asneeded basis to fund these items as they clear the bank. the balance of the book overdraft is reported as shortterm debt and the change in the book overdraft balance is reported as cash flows from financing activities. restricted funds font face new roman restricted funds primarily represent proceeds received from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities and from customers for future services under operation and maintenance projects. the proceeds of these financings are held in escrow until the designated expenditures are incurred. restricted funds expected to be released within 12 months subsequent to yearend are classified as current. utility customer accounts receivable regulated utility customer accounts receivable represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers on a cycle basis. credit is extended based on the guidelines of the applicable regulators and generally, collateral is not required. allowance for uncollectible accounts allowances for uncollectible accounts are maintained for estimated probable losses resulting from the company's inability to collect receivables from customers. accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. a number of factors are considered in determining the allowance for uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due and previous loss history. the company writesoff accounts when they become uncollectible. see note 5 99 table of contents nonregulated trade and other receivables, net. 4 nonregulated trade and other receivables, net consists of nonregulated trade accounts receivable and nonregulated unbilled revenues, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts and nonutility customer receivables of the regulated subsidiaries. in determining the reserve for uncollectible nonregulated accounts, the company considers the length of time the trade accounts receivable are past due and the customer's current ability to pay their obligation. unbilled receivables are accrued when service has been provided but has not been billed to customers. see note 6 font face new roman materials and supplies materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost is determined using the average cost method. goodwill font face new roman the company considers the carrying value of goodwill to be one of its critical accounting estimates. the company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 4 goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisitions of american water works company, inc. in 2003 and e'town corporation in 2001 the "acquisitions" and has been assigned to reporting units based on the fair values at the date of the acquisitions. the regulated utility subsidiaries have been aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit as they have similar economic characteristics. in the nonregulated segment, the business is organized into seven reporting units for its nonregulated services. in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no.142, "goodwill and other intangible assets" "sfas 142", goodwill is reviewed annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. annual impairment reviews are performed in the fourth quarter of the calendar year, in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company's annual strategic business plan. for each of the years ended december31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company determined that its goodwill, including goodwill of discontinued operations, was impaired and recorded impairments of 750,000, 509,345 and 227,802, respectively. see note 8 longlived assets the company considers the carrying value of longlived assets to be one of its critical accounting estimates. the company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets to be appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements. font face new roman longlived assets, other than goodwill, include land, buildings, equipment and longterm investments. longlived assets, other than investments and land, are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset, a significant adverse change in the manner the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition, or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. in addition, changes in the expected useful life of these longlived assets may also be an impairment indicator. when such events or changes occur, the company estimates the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the assets and compares that to the carrying value of the asset. if the carrying value is greater than the fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. 100 table of contents the key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume, rates, operating costs, labor and other benefit costs, capital additions, assumed discount rates and other economic factors. these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. if such assets are considered impaired, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. new roman the longlived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable. the company holds other investments including investments in privately held companies and investments in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. the company's investments in privately held companies and joint ventures are classified as other longterm assets. the fair values of longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which the company invests, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets. if such assets are considered impaired, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value. as a result of fair value analyses, the company recorded pretax charges of 0 for the years ended december31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and 750 for the year ended december31, 2006. advances and contributions in aid of construction new roman regulated utility subsidiaries may receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. advances for construction are refundable for limited periods of time as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. advances which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction. contributions in aid of construction are permanent collections of plant assets or cash for a particular construction project. for ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since they represent noninvestor supplied funds. noncash utility property has been received, primarily from developers, as advances or contributions of 83,041, 101,226, and 72,892 for the years ended december31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 4 generally, the company depreciates utility plant funded by contributions and amortizes its contributions balance as a reduction to depreciation expense, producing a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. certain of the company's subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property, based on regulatory guidelines. amortization of contributions in aid of construction was 20,219, 20,720 and 16,697 for the years ended december31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. new roman recognition of revenues revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are provided and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the latest meter reading to the end of the accounting period. 4 the company has agreements with the united states government to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems at various military bases pursuant to 50 year contracts "military agreements". these contracts also include construction components which are accounted for separately from the operations and management components. the military agreements are subject to periodic price redetermination adjustments and modifications for changes in circumstance. additionally, the company has agreements ranging in length from three to 40 years with various municipalities to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems "oamp.m agreements". revenue from operations and management services are recognized as services are provided. see note 16 101 table of contents construction contracts font face new roman in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants' statement of position 811, "accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain production type contracts," revenues from construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the estimated percentage of completion during the period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract. losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable. revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue. billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. under these agreements, revenues were 47,889, 32,141 and 56,069 and operation and maintenance expenses were 44,227, 34,543 and 53,845 as of december31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. included in the amounts are construction revenues of 25,766 and 12,902 and operation and maintenance expenses of 24,852 and 12,601 related to the company's fillmore contract at december 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. the construction phase of the contract is expected to be completed by december of 2009. font face new roman taxes the parent company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for u.s. tax purposes. members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns. font face new roman certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. the company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements. these deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. in addition, the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences, previously flowed through to customers, reverse. investment tax credits have been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service lives of the related assets. the company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense. the company accounts for sales tax collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities on a net basis. allowance for funds used during construction "afudc" font face new roman afudc is a noncash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant which represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity funds devoted to plant under construction. the regulated utility subsidiaries record afudc to the extent permitted by the regulators. environmental costs. 4 the company's water and wastewater operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements relating to environmental protection, and as such the company periodically becomes subject to environmental claims in the normal course of business. environmental expenditures that relate to current operations or provide a 102 table of contents future benefit are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated. remediation costs accrued amounted to 10,538 and 11,000 at december31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. included in these balances were 10,100 of estimated liabilities pursuant to a conservation agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the company with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration requiring the company to, among other provisions, implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the carmel river watershed in the state of california. the company pursues recovery of incurred costs through all appropriate means, including regulatory recovery through customer rates. the company expects to make an initial payment of 3,500 in april of 2009 and 1,100 annually from july 2010 to july 2016. new accounting standards in january 2009, the financial accounting standards board "fasb" issued fasb staff position "fsp" emerging issues task force "eitf" no. 99201, "amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no. 9920" "fsp eitf 99201". this pronouncement amends eitf 9920, "recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets" "eitf 9920", to achieve more consistent determination of whether an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred. fsp eitf 99201 also retains and emphasizes the objective of an other thantemporary impairment assessment and the related disclosure requirements in statement of financial accounting standards "sfas" no. 115, "accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities," and other related guidance. fsp eitf 99201 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december 15, 2008, and is required to be applied prospectively. the adoption of fsp eitf 99201 did not have an impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. in december 2008, the fasb issued fsp fas no. 132r1, "employers' disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets" "fsp fas 132r1", which requires additional disclosures for employers' pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets. as pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were not included within the scope of sfas no. 157, "fair value measurements" "sfas 157", fsp fas 132r1 requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets similar to the disclosures required under sfas no. 157, the investment policies and strategies for the major categories of plan assets, and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. fsp fas 132r1 will be effective for the company as of december 31, 2009. as fsp fas 132r1 provides only disclosure requirements, the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. in october2008, the fasb issued fsp no.1573, "determining the fair value of a financial asset when a market for that asset is not active" "fsp1573", which clarifies the application of sfas 157 in an inactive market and provides an example to demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive. fsp1573 was effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued. the adoption of this standard as of september30, 2008 did not have an impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. in february 2008, the fasb issued fsp sfas1572 which allows a oneyear deferral of adoption of sfas157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities such as intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and goodwill that are required to be measured at fair value on a periodic basis such as at acquisition or impairment. the company elected to use this deferral option and accordingly, only partially adopted sfas 157 on january1, 2008. sfas 157 will be adopted for the company's nonfinancial assets and liabilities valued on a nonrecurring basis on january1, 2009. on january1, 2008, the company adopted the provisions of sfas 157 for financial assets and liabilities, and nonfinancial assets and liabilities with recurring measurements. the company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period were cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds and shortterm debt. these assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on the balance sheet date using quoted 103 table of contents prices in active markets level 1 inputs, as defined by sfas 157. the adoption of sfas 157 for the company's financial assets and liabilities did not have a material effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. the company measured the assets of its defined benefit pension and other post retirement welfare plans pursuant to sfas 157 at december31, 2008. the company does not believe the adoption of sfas157 for the company's nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have an impact on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 4 in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.160 "sfas 160", "noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements151.an amendment of arb no.51," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. sfas 160 is effective for the company on january1, 2009. the company does not believe the standard will have an impact on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows. in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.141r "sfas141r", "business combinations," which will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. sfas 141r is effective for the company for business combinations finalized on or after january1, 2009. in december 2008, the company expensed transaction costs of approximately 860 for acquisitions that will not close until after january1, 2009 and will not be capitalized as goodwill under the provisions of sfas 141r. in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.159, "the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities151.including an amendment of fasb statement no.115" "sfas 159". this standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. this standard is effective for years beginning january1, 2008. the company has not elected to exercise the fair value irrevocable option. therefore, the adoption of sfas 159 did not have an impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no.158, "employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans151.an amendment of fasb statements no.87, 88, 106 and 132r" "sfas 158". this statement requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. under sfas 158, actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition obligations and assets that have not been recognized in net periodic benefit cost under previous accounting standards will be recognized as a regulatory asset for the portion of the underfunded liability that meets the recovery criteria prescribed in sfas 71 and as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, for that portion of the underfunded liability that does not meet sfas 71 regulatory accounting criteria. the company adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of the statement as of the end of fiscal year 2006. reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made to conform previously reported data to the current presentation. note 3 acquisitions. 4 during 2008, the company closed on acquisitions of 10 regulated water and wastewater systems, for an aggregate purchase price of 12,512, including transaction costs of 2,622. the purchase price was allocated to the net tangible assets based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. font face new roman during 2007, the company acquired nine regulated water systems for a total aggregate purchase price of 15,877. included in this total was the company's acquisition on november1, 2007 of all of the capital stock of s.j. services, inc. "sjs" for 13,458. the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with sfas 141. accordingly, operating results of sjs from november1, 2007 were included in the company's results of operations. the purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets based 104 table of contents upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. total sjs assets acquired were 23,420, including 4,727 of goodwill see note 8, and liabilities assumed totaled 9,962, including longterm debt of 2,791 and contributions in aid of construction of 5,566. also during 2007, the company's new jersey subsidiary entered into an agreement with the city of trenton, new jersey to purchase the assets of the city's water system located in the four surrounding townships. the agreement required approval from the new jersey regulator. the initial proposed purchase price of 100,000 was subsequently amended to 75,000. in addition the agreement has been amended to include the provision of technical services from the city over seven years to ensure a smooth transition of ownership at a total cost of 5,000. the administrative law judge hearing the matter has issued an initial decision the "initial decision" approving a stipulation of settlement reflecting the changed agreement the "stipulation" and sent the initial decision to the new jersey regulator for consideration. on february 25, 2009, a petition seeking a referendum was filed with the city of trenton. the petition seeks to force the city council to reconsider its prior approval of sale, and a vote as to whether the ordinance approving the sale of the system should go forward or be negated. the company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the referendum nor can the company provide assurance that the initial decision will ultimately be approved by the new jersey regulator. included in the stipulation, and dependent upon final approval, the company intends to purchase finished water from the city for the next 20 years under a water supply agreement. the acquisition is expected to add approximately forty thousand customers to the company's customer base. included in other current assets is a 10,000 refundable deposit the company made in december 2007 which is being held in an interest bearing escrow account as required by the bidding process. note 4 utility plant. 4

include various regulatory balancing accounts. note 8 goodwill the company's annual impairment reviews are performed as of november30 of each year, in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company's annual strategic business plan. at november30, 2008, the company's goodwill was 1,704,310. during december 2008, the company transferred 4,793 of goodwill to regulatory assets for purchase premiums recoverable through rates, resulting in the 1,699,517 balance outstanding at december31, 2008, as shown in the table below. the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred. 4 the company uses a twostep impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any in accordance with sfas no.142. the step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fair value for each of the company's reporting units to their respective net carrying values book values, including goodwill, on the measurement date. if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit's carrying value, then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit. the step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares, by reporting unit, the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill. the implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit's identified assets and liabilities. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit. 4 the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit's assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date. 4 for the november30, 2008 impairment test, the estimated fair value of the regulated reporting unit for step1 was based on a combination of the following valuation techniques - observable trading prices of comparable equity securities of publiclytraded water utilities considered by us to be the company's peers. and - discounted cash flow models developed from the company's internal forecasts. 4 the estimated fair values of the nonregulated reporting units were determined entirely on the basis of discounted cash flow models. 108 table of contents the first valuation technique applies average peer multiples to the regulated reporting unit's historic and forecasted cash flows. the peer multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable equity securities of publiclytraded water utilities, their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for those peers. the second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit's fiveyear cash flows using an estimated longterm growth rate and discounts these cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital. if step 2 of the impairment test is required, the company determines the fair value of the applicable reporting unit's assets and liabilities. the fair values for the majority of such assets and liabilities are equal to their carrying values. however, the fair values of the applicable debt are highly dependent upon market conditions surrounding the measurement date. for the step 2 calculations of the fair value of debt, the company uses observable prices of instruments and indices that have risks similar to those instruments being valued, adjusted to compensate for differences in credit profile, collateral, tax treatment and call features, to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit's debt. 4 the company has completed its november30, 2008 annual impairment review and does not believe that the company's goodwill balance was impaired. however, there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company's performance. these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company's stock price, a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities, the lack of an increase in the company's market price consistent with its peer companies, or decreases in control premiums and the overhang effect. a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan, such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates, could also result in an impairment charge. recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect the company's reported results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators. new roman in making the determination, the company considered both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the effect of the recent volatility in the equity and debt markets on the company's market capitalization. as such, the company believes that the current evaluation technique is more appropriate than relying solely on the current trading market value of the company's common stock. font face new roman in reaching its conclusion, the company also made certain assumptions, which it believes to be appropriate, that support the fair value of its reporting units. the company considered, in addition to the listed trading price of the company's shares, the effect on that price due to rwe's majority ownership, the effect of rwe's expected disposition of its owned company shares on the market for those shares, the applicability of a control premium to the company's shares and certain other factors the company deemed appropriate. as a result, the company concluded that the company's fair value exceeds what the company might otherwise have concluded had it relied on market price alone. in addition, given recent market conditions, management determined that it was appropriate for the company to consider the average of the company's closing market price over a thirty day period rather than using a particular date to calculate its market capitalization. the company's calculated market capitalization within its 2008 impairment test period was approximately 940,000 below the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units. the difference between the calculated market capitalization and the aggregate fair value of the reporting units which approximates book value resulted from the estimated control premium and the estimated impact to the company's market capitalization from the overhang created by rwe's announced plans to divest a substantial portion of its ownership through further public offerings of stock. 109 table of contents the estimated control premium represents the incremental premium a buyer is willing to pay to acquire a controlling, majority interest in the company. in estimating the control premium, management principally considered the current market conditions and historical premiums paid in utility acquisitions observed in the marketplace. 4 the estimated stock overhang represents the impact on the company's share price that we believe results from investor concerns over market price dilution due to the anticipated increase in the number of the company's publicly traded shares caused by the anticipated rwe sale of the company's stock. as a condition of certain state regulator approvals for rwe's sale of the company, rwe had agreed to sell 100 of its holdings of company stock by april 2010 and previously announced its intentions to reduce its interest to below 50 prior to the end of 2008. management estimated the impact of this overhang condition using reports from multiple analysts covering the company's stock and other available market information. the determination of estimated fair value required the exercise of judgment and is highly sensitive to the company's assumptions. the estimated fair values approximate the carrying value of reporting units leaving little estimated value in excess of the required threshold of the step 1 test. had the fair value been less than the carrying value of the reporting units, differences between the carrying value and fair value of our longterm debt which is not taken into account in step 1 but is required in step 2 would have increased any impairment charge indicated by step 1 by an estimated 300,000, due to accounting guidance that must be followed to measure the implied fair value of goodwill. 4 for the years ended december31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company recorded impairment charges for goodwill, including discontinued operations, in the amount of 750,000, 509,345 and 227,802, respectively. as of march31, 2008, in light of the initial public offering price and trading levels in the company's common stock subsequent to the date of the initial public offering, the company performed an interim impairment test and, on may9, 2008, management concluded that the carrying value of the company's goodwill was impaired. the company believed that the initial public offering price was indicative of the value of the company at march31, 2008, and accordingly, based on those factors recorded an impairment charge to the goodwill of its regulated reporting unit in the amount of 750,000 as of march31, 2008. the impairment charge was primarily attributed to the market price of the company's common stock both the initial public offering price and the price during subsequent trading being less than the estimate of the initial public offering price used during the 2007 annual test. also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the company's debt due to increased market interest rates. as a result of the impairment charge, rwe aqua holdings gmbh a whollyowned subsidiary of rwe transferred 245,000 to the company on may13, 2008. this cash was used to reduce shortterm debt. rwe is not obligated to make any additional capital contributions. during the third quarter of 2007, as a result of the company's debt being placed on review for a possible downgrade and the proposed sale of a portion of the company in the initial public offering, management determined at that time it was appropriate to update its valuation analysis before the next scheduled annual test. based on this assessment, the company performed an interim impairment test and recorded an impairment charge to goodwill related to its regulated reporting unit in the amount of 243,345 as of september30, 2007. the decline was primarily due to a slightly lower longterm earnings forecast caused by updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery. font face new roman the company completed its scheduled annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007 and determined an impairment had occurred based upon information regarding the company's market value in connection with the initial public offering. management determined that the indicative fair value of the company based on estimates of the initial public offering price range was the best evidence of the company's market value and incorporated this indicated market value into the company's valuation methodology, which also considered other items, such as peer multiples, discounted cash flows and a control premium. based on the results of the impairment test, an impairment of 266,000 to the company's carrying value was recognized as of december31, 2007. 110 table of contents the 2006 impairment charge of 227,802 was attributable to higher interest rates in the regulated reporting unit and a change in the potential net realizable value of a nonregulated reporting unit. the change

company intends to remarket the bonds until maturity. during january and february of 2009, awcc purchased these bonds because no buyer was willing to purchase the bonds at market rates. buyers periodically purchased the bonds at market rates during january and february of 2009. since the debt has been remarketed for periods no longer than one week and the company cannot be certain

private activity bonds and government funded debt is collateralized by utility plant. longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, limit, subject to certain exceptions, the company from issuing debt secured by the company's assets. certain long term notes require the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. in addition, the company has 1,104,902 of notes which include the right to redeem the notes in whole or in part from time to time subject to certain

and equity contributions to repay longterm and shortterm rwe notes, repay outstanding commercial paper and for other corporate purposes amounting to 2,011,530, 624,446 and 548,116, respectively. 4 a portion of the rwe notes that were redeemed in 2007 were obtained for the use of certain of the company's regulated subsidiaries. these notes were redeemed early resulting in a difference of 8,655 between the book value of the rwe notes and the cash consideration required to extinguish the notes. as agreed with the applicable regulators, the difference on extinguishment was deferred as a regulatory liability by the company's regulated subsidiaries and will be amortized to interest, net over the remaining lives of the original rwe notes for periods ranging from 2014 to 2034. the amount

facility to september15, 2013. on december18, 2008, the bank of new york mellon joined the credit facility syndicate with a commitment amount of 40,000 through september15, 2012. if any lender defaults in its obligation to fund advances, the company may request the other lenders to assume the default lender's commitment or replace such defaulting lender by designating an assignee willing to assume the commitment, however the remaining lenders have no obligation to assume a defaulting lender's commitment and we can provide no assurances that we will replace a defaulting lender. at

applicable margin based upon credit ratings of the company, as well as total outstanding amounts under the agreement at the time of the borrowing. the maximum libor margin is 55 basis points. 118 table of contents the credit facility requires the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. the ratio at december 31, 2008 was 0.56 to 1.00. none of the company's borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under the company's credit facilities. 4 as part of the normal course of business, the company routinely enters contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, fuels and other services. these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the company and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the company is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. depending on its net position with a counterparty, the demand could be for the posting of collateral. in the absence of expressly agreed provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, the obligation to supply the collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the company's situation at the time of the demand. if the company can reasonably claim that it is willing and financially able to perform its obligations, it may be possible to successfully argue that no collateral should be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months of future payments should be sufficient. the company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. awcc has entered into a one year 10,000 committed revolving line of credit with pnc bank, n.a. this line of credit will terminate on december31, 2009 unless extended and is used primarily for shortterm working capital needs. interest rates on advances under this line of credit are based on either the prime rate of the financial institution or the applicable libor rate for the term selected plus 200 basis points. new roman note 13 general taxes components of

carryforwards are more likely than not to be recovered and require no valuation allowance. the company evaluated its ability to fully utilize the existing federal nol carryforwards in light of the partial ownership change by rwe. under internal revenue code "i.r.c." section 382, an ownership change occurs if there is a greater than fifty percent 50 change in equity ownership of a company over a three year period determined by reference to the ownership of persons holding five percent 5 or more of that company's equity securities. if a company undergoes an ownership change as defined by i.r.c. section 382, the company's ability to utilize its prechange nol carryforwards to offset postchange income may be limited. the company believes that the limitation imposed by i.r.c. section 382 generally should not preclude use of its federal nol carryforwards, assuming the company has sufficient taxable income in future carryforward periods to utilize those nol carryforwards. the company's federal nol carryforwards do not begin expiring until 2025. at december31, 2008 and 2007, the company recorded state nol's of 431,694 and 381,623, respectively, the majority of which are offset by a valuation allowance because the company does not believe these nol's are more likely than not to be realized because the state nol carryforwards began expiring in 2008. at december31, 2008 and 2007, the company had canadian nol carryforwards of 17,528 and 20,155, respectively. the majority of these carryforwards are offset by a valuation allowance because the company does not believe these nol's are more likely than not to be realized because the canadian nol carryforwards began expiring in 2008. 121 table of contents at december31, 2008 and 2007, the company had capital loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of 17,614 and 19,977, respectively. the company has recognized a full valuation allowance for the capital loss carryforwards because the company does not believe these losses are more likely than not to be recovered. 4 the company files income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal, state and local or nonu.s income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003. new roman during 2006, the company filed federal refund claims with the internal revenue service "irs". the majority of the company's refund claims were attributable to the carry back of nol's generated in 2003. the refund claims procedurally required approval by the joint committee of taxation "jct". the company received notification from the irs outlining their final findings from the audit to which the company and irs agreed. in the fourth quarter of 2008, the company received approximately 28,652 in refunds excluding interest of 6,317. the company has state income tax examinations in progress and does not expect material adjustments to result. the company adopted fin 48 effective january1, 2007. the adoption did not have any impact to the company's opening balance of accumulated deficit in 2007 because the positions taken were adequately reserved. the company's gross fin 48 liability, excluding interest and penalties, for unrecognized tax benefits decreased during 2008 as follows balance at january 1, 2007 2,202 decreases relating to tax authority settlements 36 decreases due to statute of limitations 524 balance at december 31, 2007 1,642 decreases due to lapse of statute of limitations 291 balance at december31, 2008 1,351 the liability balance as of december 31, 2008 and 2007 does not include interest and penalties of 312 and 341, respectively, which is recorded as a component of income tax expense. the company does not anticipate material changes to its unrecognized tax benefits within the next year. if the company sustains all of its positions at december 31, 2008 and 2007, an unrecognized tax benefit of 1,104 and 1,396, respectively, excluding interest and penalties, would impact the company's effective tax rate. font face new roman note 15 employee benefits pension and other postretirement benefits. 4 the company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible nonunion employees of its regulated utility and shared services operations. benefits under the plans are based on the employee's years of service and compensation. the pension plans have been closed for any employees hired on or after january1, 2006. union employees hired on or after january1, 2001 had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement. union employees hired on or after january1, 2001 and nonunion employees hired on or after january1, 2006 are provided with a 5.25 of base pay defined contribution plan. the company's funding policy is to contribute at least the minimum amount required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974. pension plan assets are invested in a number of investments including equity and bond mutual funds, fixed income securities and guaranteed interest contracts with insurance companies. 122 table of contents pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates charged for utility services as contributions are made to the plans. see note 7 the company also has several unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits to certain employees. font face new roman the company maintains postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. the retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after january1, 2006. the plans had previously closed for nonunion employees hired on or after january1, 2002. the company's policy is to fund postretirement benefit costs accrued. plan assets are invested in equity and bond mutual funds. the obligations of the plans are dominated by obligations for active employees. because the timing of expected benefit payments is so far in the future and the size of the plan assets are small relative to the company's assets, the investment strategy is to allocate a large portion of assets to equities, which the company believes will provide the highest return over the longterm period. the fixed income assets are invested in long duration debt securities in order to better match the duration of the plan liability. the liabilities of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans were adjusted to their fair value at the time of the acquisitions. the company periodically conducts an asset liability modeling study to ensure the investment strategy is aligned with the profile of the obligations. the longterm goals are to maximize the plan funded status and minimize contributions and pension expense, while taking into account the potential volatility risks on each of these items. 4 none of the company's securities are included in pension or other postretirement benefit plan assets. combined plan assets of the benefit plan's include approximately 500 of rwe securities at december 31, 2008. the asset allocation for the company's u.s. pension plan at

in august 2006, the pension protection act "ppa" was signed into law in the u.s. the ppa replaces the funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans by requiring that defined benefit plans contribute to a 100 of the current liability funding target over 7 years. defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80 of the current liability are defined as being "at risk" and additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply. the ppa was effective for the 2008 plan year with shortterm phasein provisions for both the funding target and atrisk determination. the company's qualified defined benefit plan is currently funded above the atrisk threshold, and therefore the company expects that the plans will not be subject to the "at risk" funding requirements of the ppa. the company is proactively monitoring the plan's funded status and projected contributions under the new law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements. 4 minimum

extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, the rate of future compensation increases received by the company's employees, mortality, turnover and medical costs. each assumption is reviewed annually. the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes. the significant assumptions related

u.s.151.issued aa151.graded corporate bonds, all of which were non callable or callable with makewhole provisions. for each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. font face new roman the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plans' investment portfolios. assumed projected rates of return for each of the plans' projected asset classes were selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. based on the target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio was developed, adjusted for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared to the benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets. the company's pension expense increases as the expected return on assets decreases. 126 table of contents assumed health care cost trend rates have a

segment information font face new roman the company has two operating segments which are also the company's two reportable segments referred to as the regulated businesses and nonregulated businesses segments. the company's chief operating decision maker regularly reviews the operating results of the regulated and nonregulated businesses segments to assess segment performance and allocate resources. the evaluation of segment performance and the allocation of resources are based on several measures. the measure that is most consistent with that used by management is adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes from continuing operations "adjusted ebit". management has grouped the company's businesses into its regulated and nonregulated businesses segments based upon the products and services they provide and whether they function under the rules and regulations of the public utility regulatory environment. 4 the regulated businesses segment includes the company's 23 utility subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services to customers in 20 u.s. states. with the exception of one company, each of these public utility subsidiaries is subject to regulation by public utility commissions and local governments. in addition to providing similar products and services and being subject to the public utility regulatory environment, each of the regulated subsidiaries has similar economic characteristics, production processes, types and classes of customers and water distribution or wastewater collection processes. each of these companies is also subject to both federal and state regulation regarding the quality of water distributed and the discharge of wastewater residuals. the nonregulated businesses segment is comprised of nonregulated businesses that provide a broad range of nonregulated water and wastewater services and products including homeowner water and sewer line maintenance services, water and wastewater facility operations and maintenance services, granular carbon technologies and products for cleansing water and wastewater, wastewater residuals management services and water and wastewater facility engineering services. 4 the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2. the regulated and nonregulated businesses segment information includes intercompany costs that are allocated by american water works service company, inc. and intercompany interest that is charged by awcc, which are eliminated to reconcile to the consolidated results of operations. intersegment revenues, which are primarily recorded at cost plus markup that approximates current market prices, include carbon regeneration services and leased office space, furniture and equipment provided by the company's nonregulated subsidiaries to its regulated subsidiaries. other includes corporate costs which are not allocated to the company's subsidiaries, eliminations of intersegment transactions, and fair value adjustments and associated income and deductions related to the acquisitions which have not been allocated to the segments for evaluation of segment performance and allocation of resource purposes. the adjustments related to the acquisitions are reported in other, as they are excluded from segment performance measures evaluated by management. the following table includes the company's summarized segment information as of or for the year ended december 31, 2008 regulated nonregulated other consolidated net operating revenues

measure is adjusted ebit. adjusted ebit does not represent cash flow for periods presented and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company's operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a source of liquidity. adjusted ebit as defined by the company may not be comparable with adjusted ebit as defined by other companies. the following

financial disclosure. 4 none item9a. controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures american water works company, inc. maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 "the exchange act" that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. the company was not required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 "section 404" and related sec rules and regulations to perform an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2008. while we were not required to conduct a section 404 evaluation, as of december 31, 2008, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to controls over maintenance of contracts and agreements. specifically, effective controls did not exist to ensure the accuracy and completeness of accounting and disclosure for such contracts and agreements. 138 table of contents such deficiency could result in misstated consolidated financial statements affecting results of operations, financial position, cash flows and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. as a result of this material weakness, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31, 2008. nevertheless, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods, presented, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america "gaap". 4 due to a transition period established by the rules of the sec for newly public companies, this annual report does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or attestation report of the company's registered public accounting firm. font face new roman plan for remediation of material weakness we believe that we have taken the appropriate actions to remediate the material weakness described above by 1 conducting training on controls over maintenance of contracts and agreements for personnel, 2 hiring additional resources, and 3 designing and implementing new policies, procedures and controls. we believe this material weakness will remain until we have had sufficient experience with the sustainability of the controls at the levels at which they have been operating as of december 31, 2008. marginleft4 changes in internal control over financial reporting font face new roman there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter ended december 31, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. item9b. other information none. 139 table of contents part iii item10. directors, executive officers of the registrant and corporate governance font face new roman
